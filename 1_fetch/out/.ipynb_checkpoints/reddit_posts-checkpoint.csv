pregnant,Progesterone,I had a miscarriage in August and just recently found out I‚Äôm pregnant again this week. My OB had me come in as soon as I was able to for blood work. All blood work was normal but my progesterone was 19.7. The normal range according to the lab was 4.7-50.7 for first trimester. My OB‚Äôs nurse called me to give me the option of taking progesterone at night or to just monitor very closely since it‚Äôs under 20. I decided to get a prescription for it. Anyone else here use it? What‚Äôs the downside of taking it? ,1738704650.0,1iht3w2
pregnant,Do I tell the parents?,"Just getting right into it, my child‚Äôs father is not open to the idea of being a dad and has shut me out and is planning on moving back to his home country. His parents both live in the same city as me and he is refusing to let them know about their future grandchild & I‚Äôm at a loss of what to do‚Ä¶ 

Should I mail them a letter explaining that they have a grandchild on the way and leave the door open for if they choose to be involved or just ‚Ä¶ not?  I feel like they deserve to know and have the option to be in their grandchild‚Äôs life if they are open to it, it‚Äôs news that can‚Äôt be hidden forever and would be a lot harder to adjust to the longer I wait but I‚Äôm still conflicted.  

The father is also young, dumb and scared and I feel like if I be the bad guy and break the news to them they may react better than he‚Äôs expecting and it turn he will be more comfortable with wanting to coparent in the future???",1738704305.0,1ihsytn

pregnant,Meal train once baby arrives,"For those who had someone set up a meal train for them once baby arrived‚Äî did you appreciate it? Did you wish they hadn‚Äôt done so?

Currently 36+1 and my SIL mentioned that she planned on setting up a meal train for me once baby is here. My immediate thought is entertaining visitors so soon after sounds miserable but I would feel equally bad about having them just drop it on the porch and not say anything to them. Also, it‚Äôs common to share meal trains on facebook so you can‚Äôt really control who signs up‚Ä¶ We have a lot of well-meaning people in our life through church, work, etc and some of them aren‚Äôt ones I would feel comfortable chatting with while in a diaper lol. I‚Äôm not even sure I want our closest family members coming around until a week or so of being home. Just trying to decide if I should tell my SIL not to worry about it or just to appreciate the thought and see what happens‚Ä¶

pregnant,Fetal Doppler picked up mysterious voices?,"I had a 16 week appointment this afternoon, just a routine check for heartbeat, blood pressure, weight, etc. All was normal until the PA took out the fetal doppler. We heard the baby‚Äôs heartbeat, but then I swore I heard a woman whispering. Almost immediately, the PA looked at me and said, ‚ÄúDid you hear that, too!?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúYup!!‚Äù She removed the doppler from my belly, the voice immediately stopped. She gave it a minute before putting the doppler back on my belly. As soon as she did, an adult male‚Äôs voice immediately overpowered the sound of my baby‚Äôs heartbeat. We couldn‚Äôt pick up on any exact words as it was too muffled. The woman then began responding. My baby‚Äôs heartbeat was still active in the background, but much quieter than the voices. The PA removed the doppler, waited a few minutes, and then put it higher on my stomach. Nothing out of the ordinary, just the sound of my own heartbeat. She moved it back over the baby, and both voices immediately started up again. 

The PA and I were both freaked out! She said she has never had this happen before. There was nobody else around. No phones or other offices, no computer. And definitely no adult male. 

Has this ever happened to anyone else?",1738704145.0,1ihswg9
pregnant,Question for those with migraine auras,"I‚Äôm currently 15 weeks with my second pregnancy. I‚Äôm 24 years old. I‚Äôve had migraines since I was little, they were fairly common when I was young but they subsided quite a bit in my middle/late teens years. My first pregnancy I didn‚Äôt notice any changes in this area. But this time around it‚Äôs becoming much more frequent and the auras are taking up much more of my vision than they used to. It went from maybe one or two times a month taking 15-25% of my vision, to now almost every day taking up 50% or more of my vision. It typically only lasts about an hour or so, but sometimes longer. And also, they don‚Äôt necessarily hurt most of the time, it definitely messes with me in a number of ways but not exactly painful. I‚Äôm definitely going to bring this up to my doctor, but has anyone else had this? Where your symptoms became more apparent while pregnant? It‚Äôs more than just my vision, it‚Äôs hard to think or process things while it happens. ",1738703930.0,1ihst9p

pregnant,Gestational age and LMP not matching,Hey everyone! I am confused about my cycle and just wanted some opinions! A little backstory i got pregnant at 5 months post partum and was breastfeeding so my cycle was irregular. My last period started on October 19th but on December 18th my first ultrasound put my gestational age at 5 weeks and 6 days pregnant. (I should of been at 8 weeks 4 days based on my LMP) Im confused since this doesn‚Äôt line up with week 1 being my LMP. does this mean i conceived 5 weeks and 6 days before dec 18? Or did i ovulate late? If your cycle is irregular do the first 2 weeks of gestational age still count as not technically being pregnant? Because in a typical cycle week 1 of pregnancy is LMP and ovulation is week 2. I hope that makes sense i am just curious for when my husband and i try to conceive in the future!  I am curious how to find out when i ovulated too. Im not sure if thats even possible to pinpoint but even a range would be helpful! ,1738703396.0,1ihslha

I work remotely for a Swiss company and I am so lucky to be part of such a great team.

pregnant,Epidural myth,"I‚Äôm annoyed. I went to a weekend intensive birth class with my partner run by a certified midwife. Take aways: don‚Äôt get an epidural unless you really can‚Äôt cope, push it to the last minute. Why? It slows down contractions 

I go back and report this to my friend who is a mother of 3 and a practicing Anaesthesiologist who administers epidurals for a living. She was fuming.

‚ÄúNot more of this stupid bullshit!‚Äù she said. She was mad. She said get the epidural early, as soon as you can. It takes away the pain, and stress; might allow you to sleep and gather strength. She said this stupid story pushed out by midwives results in countless women being so exhausted by pain at the end of labour that they need a c-section which is much much worse. 

She herself went to birth classes and argued with the midwife whose only reason was ‚Äúoh you should try the natural way because nature is better‚Äù. 

As my friend said: ‚Äúbullshit, we have modern medicine and women don‚Äôt need to be in pain‚Äù

So/ this is an announcement for anyone who has been misinformed. 

Google it for yourself: the research shows the labour might be slowed down by 15-20 mins if you have an epidural . Which is nothing compared to 20+hrs of pain if you ask me.

pregnant,3 weeks of nonstop heavy spotting,"Hi i'm new to reddit and new to this group. I need your help and insights.

This is my first pregnancy and i'm currently 7 weeks pregnant. I'm 29 years old. We just found out that i was pregnant 3 weeks ago and have been to the obgyne weekly for checkup.

My most recent checkup, my ob doctor said the baby is fine, i also saw my baby's heartbeat for the first time. It was not very clear my doctor also assured me and said it's because the baby is too small for now. However she still cannot find any tears or bumps in my uterus and can't find where the blood is comming. She even inserted her fingers to find any bumps inside but says there's none.

I'm just really worried because everytime i move or even if i'm not moving, blood comes out. Some days it's a heavy flow and some days i can say it's really just a spotting like what i see in google images. I suggested to her if i can drink iron meds to help my significant blood loss, she said for now she can't recommend it yet because iron may cause nausea and if i am sensitive (which currently i am even to food or smell) i may cause vomiting which will not help. Just earlier today i took CBC test per her recommendation i have not seen the results yet.

My current setup is sleep, bed, pee or poop, and eat. I don't move much, sometimes i sweep the bedroom floor, tidy the room with very minimal movements. And I work graveyard. I wakeup 10:30pm do my job in my room which is also my office, and then by 8am i lie down eat breakfast then sleep. I'm currently drinking Progesterone 3x a day and folic acid daily.

pregnant,I need to vent. My depression is all time high.,"So I moved to Texas 4 years ago from california. I had 3 kids at the time and we moved in with my mom because she was building a house and she invited us to live there until we could buy our own place. My two sisters also live with my mom. Everyone was living peacefully until my husband got arrested for public intoxication. He went to rehab, came back, busted his shoulder and needed emergency surgery so he was out of work for a year. 

I got a job, tried to pay our bills but it wasnt enough. Tried getting on assistance and we were denied and I still couldnt figure out why. So i racked up credit card debt. Almost 15k. Food, school supplies, diapers, etc. so our plans to buy a home have been put in hold. We still live with my mom, as we are trying to get debt down to move out. Husband has debt from the surgery, and credit cards as well. 

My mother is an interesting woman. Been single for 19 years now. Youngest sister in college in OKC. middle sis is autistic (aspergers) cannot live on her own, and will live with mom forever probably. Now, my mom hates children. I didnt realize this until recently. She is OCD and when one thing is out of place she is panicking. I grew up keeping things clean because thats just how I was raised. I had hoped my mom would calm down in older age but sadly, not. She is a facebook grandma. She likes the kids when they are happy and independent. A few photo ops and shes done with them. Always complaining that they left a cup of juice out or they are crying too much. She hates kids under age 10. She also expects them to behave like adults? Currently, I have a 8,6,3 year old. They are well behaved but they are KIDS. They cry, they make a mess, they dont always eat their veggies. This irks my mom to no end. 

I am now pregnant with 4th child accidentally. Believe me, this was not how I wanted this to go. I wanted an abortion. Texas doesnt allow that. My husband is iffy on the whole thing so we ended up agreeing to keep it. I had a nice cushy job with a giant promotion underway and had to quit due to hyperemesis taking over.

So, now we have one income. 3 kids. One on the way. Im home all day with my mom and Im going insane. She travels for work a lot. When she gets home, immediately she is complaining about something. The pantry door being open is like a big deal apparently. Mind you Im still pregnant (8 months) i clean everyday, i pick up after my kids. I try to stay upstairs so my kids‚Äô existence doesnt bother her. She even told me my kids arent allowed in the pantry to grab food because they mess up the organization of the pantry. Im living in absolute hell. We cant afford to move out AND pay off debt. We cant pay our bills as it is on one income. My car is probably getting repoed. I dont have anything for new baby because all our money goes to bills and food for the three kids we have already. I dont qualify for assistance because husband makes too much money despite we pay 800$ a month in health insurance, and we are paying off medical debt and loans he took out for rehab and his surgery. 

Long story I know, if you made it this far, bless you. Im just done. We want to leave as soon as possible. My mom and I fight everyday at least and shes one of those ‚Äúoh well i guess im just a shitty mom for letting you live here and make a mess‚Äù type people. She wonders why her grandkids want nothing to do with her and why we hang out upstairs. Ive tried to tell her her OCD is getting to the point where she is actively hurting relationships over it but she doesnt care. I cant wait to pay off our debt and never look back. This is a woman I do not recognize. She has changed since my sister left for college 3 years ago (her favorite kid) and I feel like im being punished for it. 

Again, if you read all that, bless you. Im just so depressed and stressed out at this point on how we will make it financially and mentally. We need to leave asap.

I love my wife so much... but she is such a little thing... she's 5'1"" and maybe just over 100 lbs soaking wet. 

The past 3-4 years she has been running 10K's DAILY, so she is in great cardio and general shape... it is just the weight part that scares me.

She is ""vegan"" and eats 90% vegetables and fruits, but she does eat yogurt, eggs and bars for some sort of protein source because I basically make her lol... Even then, I'd bet she is getting just barely 1000 calories/day from her usual diet... 1,200 if I'm being generous. 

She has ALWAYS been particular about her diet, the food she eats, etc for the past 9 years. 2-3 times each year since we started dating I always try to bring up my concerns about her weight and how she needs to build some muscle. Tried telling her that ""putting weight"" on doesn't make you ""fat"", but healthier in her case since she's already so little. Just looking for advice on what you all realistically think or if y'all know how common something would be to go wrong for someone like [her.as](http://her.as) well as some examples I could maybe propose to her to show her that she really does need to be eating more food for both her health and our babies health.

The Dr said it could possibly be too early or a ectopic pregnancy. So I was sent home after blood work to check my HCG levels. This was on January 29th.

Fast forward to today, I was having sharp needle pains in my  left lower abdomen and when I stood up I was feeling light headed on the left side and weak. 

Went to the emergency room to see if I was having a ectopic pregnancy and the did confirm from looking at the ultrasound that there was a gestational sac, but it was reaching the top of my fallopian tube. The OB Dr. says it could be a possibility the egg will or embryo could either slip in my tube or slip into my uterus so she ruled out the Ectopic pregnancy since this is a pregnancy I want to keep she discharged me. 

I need advice from you guys has this ever happen to anyone? Or am I putting myself in danger? They did confirm I was 7 weeks with no fetal pole it‚Äôs kind of stressful going through this I praying my baby survives.

I'm due in June, and I've negotiated a ""return to work"" plan after I give birth. This will will enable me to work a part-time/flex schedule, that will stretch my leave all the way to November. Once I use up all my leave benefits, my plan is to return back to full-time. 

At least that's the goal. 

Not sure how I'll feel once I have a 5 month old, but I'm already feeling bad returning to work full time with a baby so young. 

Has anyone had any luck negotiating with your employer to return back to work on reduced hours, part time, or option to work partially remote? 

Presently, I'm a full time employer (in person) at a luxury event company. I hold the most seniority outside of the owners, and take on a lot of responsibilities. We are also a very small company of 8 people. My employers have been very flexible with my plans for leave (especially since I'm been very proactive in making sure my bases are covered while I'm on leave). With that being said, I was upfront with my plans, and my desire to return full-time in November. 

Only time will tell, but I'm fantasizing about taking a ""reduced"" responsibility once I return. I've been at the company for 10 years, and I still love what I do. But I'm also trying to be realistic with this new chapter in my life and how becoming a mother will impact my ability to have a full time career. 

Any other career driven mamas out there? Has anyone had luck working out a plan with employers to reduce workload or take a few step backs in regards to responsibilities? ",1738692356.0,1iho248

pregnant,Is this irritating or is this pregnancy rage??,"I'll start by saying I love my boyfriend to pieces, and I know he loves me too. Our relationship is very good and we are excited to welcome our first little one in April. This isn't about cheating or incompetence or anything... It's just driving me insane and I can't figure it out. 

The stupid jokes. 

Part of his sense of humor is almost... Boomer-ish? and it lately has made me feel like he doesn't even like women. He makes a lot of references to the ""little helper in the car"" comedy skit thing where the comedian is basically like ""well I wouldn't know how to drive if it wasn't for my wife saying the light is green/etc"". He also made a joke to one of his coworkers yesterday about how busy he is with a girlfriend at home (in front of me) and then went ""oh, she's right here"". 

I'm pretty sure he made these jokes for the years we were together before me getting pregnant and I probably just let them go, but honestly I can't remember. I can barely remember what I ate yesterday üôÉüòÇ

Am I overreacting? Is this irritating? I've never experienced pregnancy rage or anything but honestly being so upset about these jokes does feel unproportional to me so I'm thinking maybe that's it?

I know I should just tell him it bugs me and actually talk to him but I feel like none of this has the correct importance in my brain and I'll just blow up on him and I don't really want that either üòÖ",1738691484.0,1ihnov5

Then proceeded to print and ship 50 freaking cards with this QR code.

I just received the cards today, and I was getting ready to put them in envelopes. I decided to test the QR code, and the QRFY website popped up and said, ""QR code deactivated, login to reactivate."" I login.

Avoid making the same mistake as me!!! Make sure what you are using is actually free.

I‚Äôm pregnant after an ectopic pregnancy. To validate the correct placement of the pregnancy I had an ultrasound at what I calculated to be 5w0d (based on positive OPK and temp surge). The ultrasound went well, sac in uterus and the tech claimed to see an embryo and measure me at 5w6d. This was crazy to me as this would make my ovulation ahead of any intercourse we had. 

I went back 11 days later for viability. This would have been 7w3d based on the clinics initial measurement, or 6w4d based on my initial measurement based on ovulation. At this ultrasound, embryo measured 6w5d and had a heartbeat of 133BPM. 

While the heartbeat was a great thing to hear, as I sit thinking about it, the change in days dropping by 5 has given me anxiety.

Has anyone else had this? We‚Äôre about to leave for a wedding out of the country tomorrow and of course there are no appointments today to get checked. I also don‚Äôt know if this really warrants a trip to the ER?

I went to the same McDonald‚Äôs two days ago and they gave me a large iced water no problem, anyways I ended up just saying okay to the small, I then look at the lid of the cup and the water is like a pinky orange colour, clearly they accidentally mixed it or something which is kind of gross to not know what concoction I‚Äôm drinking, usually the McDonald‚Äôs water is atleast decently clear. Like they didn‚Äôt give me pure juice and I could tell as it was semi clear still, so I ended up just dumping it out unfortunately as I wasn‚Äôt comfortable drinking the mystery liquid.

pregnant,Natural birth videos to prep a husband?,"So my husband and I were doing an online infant care class last night, and upon simply seeing the baby in the video receive a heel prick for genetic screening, he got pretty squirmy. 

I was amazed lol. He's great and he wants very much to be there for me in labor and to help, but seeing this reaction has got me a little nervous about having him in the delivery room. I told him he's not going into the delivery room until I've seen him watch a real birth, and until I'm confident that he won't turn into Patient #2 on the floor as I'm pushing our baby out. 

Has anyone had their husbands watch such videos? Does anyone know or can recommend some to us? It certainly doesn't have to be a close-up of all the gory details, since he won't be all up in that business anyway, but I want him to be able to see a natural birth from the kind of vantage point that he'll have in the delivery room.

pregnant,6 months pregnant and husband is having a mental health crisis,"I just need a safe space to vent. The short story is that my husband is experiencing delusions. His behavior has been very erratic, and that‚Äôs nothing new, but it‚Äôs become increasingly more concerning. After confronting him with my concerns last week he accepted that he should seek help for his mental health. Unfortunately things have just snowballed since then. I don‚Äôt want to be too specific here, but, he really believes that he‚Äôs being followed, that ‚Äúthey‚Äù have infiltrated his workplace, and that he will essentially be taken away for something that isn‚Äôt a reality. I sympathize with him, I really do. I just can‚Äôt handle the situation anymore. He finally called to make appointments yesterday with MH professionals, but they‚Äôre not until the weekend. I can‚Äôt sleep, I can‚Äôt eat, and am overly stressed. After really realizing that there is no convincing him that this isn‚Äôt real or easing his anxiety, I was researching his symptoms and realized the severity of the situation and it just hit me like a ton of bricks. I had a full blown panic attack and felt like I was going to pass out because I was hyperventilating. I managed to calm down and then immediately felt such guilt that I put my baby through that situation. I am 6 months pregnant and felt tons and tons of movement after the initial panic settled and just feel so bad I allowed myself to get to that point and have that sort of reaction. I‚Äôm living in such a constant state of stress and haven‚Äôt been taking care of myself this last month. I‚Äôm not sleeping much because I worry all night and haven‚Äôt been really doing any self care. I called off work today and am just checking in with my body and feel like today is the day I need to reach out to my husband‚Äôs father and let him know what is going on in case the situation worsens before he is able to get professional help. 

I don‚Äôt know. I just feel devastated that this is happening and worried for my husband and what this means for him. Even now, I‚Äôm just rotting on the couch and trying not to panic about the current state of our lives. ",1738680480.0,1ihjay9
pregnant,I want an elective c-section but I‚Äôm feeling really scared,"I‚Äôm 32w today and ever since I was around 10w I wanted to have an elective c-section due to the fact I‚Äôm 19 years old and I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder. I have an anxiety attack a few times a day, so vaginal birth would be traumatic and dangerous for both me and our son so I think my decision is mature and my husband and our families agree. I‚Äôd rather our son need some help breathing outside the womb rather than him going into stress during one of my attacks and dying. With that being said though when I finally got to talk to someone about requesting a c-section I was over the moon and relieved as I was trying to request one for ages not knowing who I‚Äôd get to talk too. I was told everything that could happen to me if I had a c-section and that‚Äôs when the fear set in. I‚Äôm going to be going in and trusting strangers with my life and my sons life and the though of it is terrifying. I have 3 weeks until my next appointment when I can fully request my c-section and then after that I‚Äôll have less than 3 weeks until my actual c-section occurs so I‚Äôll have no time to mentally prepare for it once it sets in what‚Äôs going to happen to me. The woman really scared me with all the possible ways to die from it üòÇ.

So anyway, I'd love to know if you had good days in the first trimester without feeling nauseous/vomming after struggling with consistent nausea & fatigue.

pregnant,Newborn help,"Hello, My baby is currently 4 days old. He is beautiful, and perfect and I'm on cloud 9. 

Apart from that, I am losing my mind at this whole feeding/sleeping thing. I don't understand it, I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Please help. I know every baby is different and they'll all have different responses, so let's just get that out of the way right away. But maybe something you did will work for my baby as well. 

I've read that newborns will often fall asleep during feeds, which then you have to rouse them in order to give them a ""full feed"" before they sleep. That way they'll be full enough to sleep for like 2-3h. At first I realized that I was giving him ""snacks"" cause he would sleep for like maybe 2 min and be fussy again, showing feeding cues. And we'd be doing the dance of eat/sleep all day and night without him getting like a solid hour (at least) of sleep. I managed to sort of do the full feed over night and my partner and I were able to finally sleep for 1-2h over night. But it's SUCH a hit and miss. It seems like he's back on the doesn't-wanna-lie-down sleep train, unless in our arms. And we did that the first night it was awful, neither of us got sleep. Does anyone have good tips or advice on how you managed to build a bit of a formula for your newborn, or should I give up on hoping he sleep for longer than just intermittent sleep? I don't want him falling asleep in our arms all the time in order to get a good rest. Thank you for reading! ",1738678459.0,1ihikme

pregnant,How to deal with MIL?,"Hi, i‚Äôm 34+4 today, and I need some advice on dealing with my MIL.

For context, i‚Äôm Japanese and my partner and his parents are Dutch. I am also a neonatal intensive care & pediatric nurse so I‚Äôm quite sure with all the things that are safe for kids & babies (this is also not my first pregnancy and have an 8yr old but my first child with my current partner).

My entire pregnancy hasnt been easy‚Äî my MIL had a lot of opinions about my relationship with her son and how I should handle the pregnancy to the point that one summer I decided to go back to my home country for a little bit of peace of mind. When my partner also first told her about the news, her first response was ‚ÄûWell, how are you going to deal with the baby when you separate?‚Äù, which was very odd to me. She also kept saying things like ‚ÄûOh I used to do this & that for him but now you‚Äôre doing it‚Äù, and remarks like im trying to kill her son whenever I make Asian food that my partner request. 

Another thing I find so odd is that she downloaded a pregnancy tracker app to keep updated with my pregnancy. She would also ask my partner dates of appointments related to the pregnancy and write it in her planner (I‚Äôve seen it happen several times whenever we go visit them whenever his dad ask for help). She would also get upset whenever I don‚Äôt follow her advices‚Äî she would for example give an advice on how to deal with pains (im suffering from severe spd pain & cannot as much walk) and she would follow up on me and get upset I haven‚Äôt done what she said. She also gets upset whenever there is a baby item/furniture she thinks we need but my partner & I decided not to get, and would keep asking questions why I dont think I should get it and would list reasons why we should.

A recent issue happened wherein my FIL invited us over for dinner and asked if I could make sushi so I willingly did. The dinner went well until my MIL brought out ice cream and chocolates and when I was done eating, she then asked if I knew that sweets are not generally good for babies. In my head, if youre gonna question me about desserts, why give me some in the first place. I kept quiet like I usually did (im very polite, think Japanese polite, as my mother reminded me a lot as a child) since I don‚Äôt want to start problems but she went on to say infront of my FIL & partner that I am very rude (she called me disrespectful 3x last summer for being with her son when she told me about her son‚Äôs Dutch ex gf). I cried in the car on the way home and fell asleep upset. I thought that was over until she texted me saying things about cultural differences and how I cannot handle direct Dutch communication. I chose not to reply for my sanity.
She also said she would want her own bed in our baby room which is accessible through my partner& I‚Äôs bedroom for when the baby arrives to babysit. There are other things more but this is getting long.

My MIL doesn‚Äôt take no for an answer and this pregnancy is very difficult because of her. My partner has done everything to keep her off but she would say she doesn‚Äôt know what we‚Äôre talking about & get upset we‚Äôre taking her negatively. My partner & I also agreed we don‚Äôt want visitors as soon as the baby is here since I have a planned C section & we just want time to adjust and get to know our baby but it seems like my MIL wants to be involved right away. My family is abroad so we dont really have problems with them. I‚Äôm so lost and stressed about establishing boundaries with my MIL as im due soon üò©

pregnant,I don't get Doxylamine/pyridoxine prescribed,"Hii everyone, 
I've been experiencing severe morning sickness since week 5/6 I'm currently 16+2 and located in the Netherlands. After weeks of trying different types of medicine I finally got some Zofran in week 12. However, my OB does not want me to take it any longer as I'm not dehydrated anymore. But I'm still very nauseous all day and I can't do much, I'm still dry heaving like 8 times a day and occasionally vomit. If I go on walks or to the grocery store I'm gagging so much to the point I have to vomit. Any small movements mess me up so bad it's ridiculous. I have this nasty stomach feeling 24/7 with nausea and I just can't get rid of it. It has been a bit better since week 14 (not vomiting all day) but I'm still waiting for it to go away. I haven't been to work in 11 weeks! 

I asked for doxylamine/pyridoxine which is a combo I've read a lot about here. But I've called my OB and my doctor and they both said it's not safe enough to take which has me confused. I've read on this sub that so many women take it. I'm now back on meclozine/pyridoxine which I've taken before and it didn't help. But because I was severely sick then they hope it will have a better effect now. I'm so done with this feeling I just want to be able to do stuff again! I've never felt so depressed in my life as these past 11 weeks. Do any of you have experience with medication that didn't work at first but in later stages it did? Most women should already feel better at 16 weeks and I'm so scared it will have it my entire pregnancy. Do any of you take meclozine and does it work for you? ",1738671718.0,1ihgexa

This is an odd post to write but I found out yesterday that at 39 years old, I am pregnant. We were trying but expecting to be unsuccessful. We were both floored when I tested positive.

The thing is, since I found out, I've been freaking out. I haven't slept well, trouble eating. I am so incredibly anxious. I am nervous about the pregnancy, the birth, the sleepless nights, the post and pre natal depression I am likely to get. I am worried that we have thrown a massive bomb into our beautiful, perfect, peaceful little lives.

I never wanted kids but as I've gotten older, I've seen other people's children grow up to these beautiful, touching relationships and thought how precious that is. But I am so scared about the 10+ years it takes to get to that point and whether we've made a mistake. My partner always wanted a big family and I want to at least try and give him one child.

I also had cramp around my lower stomach.

Because of this I phoned the early pregnancy unit (after testing positive) and they told me I would have to wait to come in as it was too early (4 weeks) to pick anything up on a scan.

I have been optimistic that everything would be fine because I have continued to test positive AND I felt a lot of symptoms that only started a day or so before I took my positive test - tiredness, nausea and firm boobs.

Yesterday I started bleeding again - not red but a brownish rust colour with some small clotting. I also had cramp and some very mild lower back pain (which I hadn‚Äôt experienced before)

- do keep in mind I am lactose intolerant and do suffer consequence on my actions almost daily for my love of cheese so I can‚Äôt always differ if I‚Äôm having a light cramp uterus or if it‚Äôs more just stomach pain

pregnant,"It's very hard for me to keep track of my babies movements because of my ADHD, and thats ok","It causes me to have quite a bit of anxiety,  and I imagine that it causes anxiety for other ADHD parents to be as well, especially if like me you have time blindness as a symptoms.


It feels like the first of many things to be ashamed of as a mom/afab parent. There's a billion different things and expectations that it feels almost impossible to comprehend being a ""good parent"". I already feel like a failure of a partner cause of how much I struggle to keep the house clean, mainly because of the dishes and the laundry. Those 2 chores are the absolute bain of my existence. But back to the point, keeping track of how many times baby moves an hour can feel impossible. Mainly because an hour can feel like it's 5 minutes or 70 years depending on what I'm doing. 


More often than not i realized it's been a couple of hours sense I noticed baby moving, generally when baby is napping of course, and it sends me on an anxiety spiral. I'm fairly used to anxiety spirals, so generally I'm able to logic my way out of it and can breath through the panic. However, panicking makes me feel bad cause ""cortisol is bad for the baby!"" And then waking up the baby makes me feel better about her being alive, but then bad about her having been woken up cause here mom can't get a grip and manage to keep track of her movements earlier. 



All in all, mom guilt is intense, hits early, and there are countless sources of it for neuro divergent and neuro typical people alike. Be nice to yourself, remember that bad parents almost never question whether or not their bad parents, and find a therapist if you're in a position to be able to do so. Also that lil voice in your head that tells you you're doing everything wrong? Yeah give it a stupid name and mock it when it gets to be too mean.

pregnant,Guilt of not working 1st Trimester,"I‚Äôm 7 weeks 5 days today and feeling super super grateful we‚Äôre having a baby, but my god am I struggling to still be a human being. 
I‚Äôm going into my third week off sick from work as I‚Äôve had super bad nausea and sickness. I‚Äôve been on cyclizine for a week now and it‚Äôs definitely helping nausea wise but the drowsiness it‚Äôs causing has made me incapable of leaving the sofa let alone the house. I‚Äôm hoping another week of taking it and my body will adjust and feel less sleepy and I can function again. 
I just feel so guilty as I know so many women who have just carried on as normal and I can‚Äôt help but beat myself up a bit mentally with why can‚Äôt I just get on with it. 
I‚Äôm incredibly lucky to have a super supportive partner who wants me to think of nothing but my health and to rest, but I still just feel a lil bit useless. 
Praying to any god that will listen that this is just first trimester sickness/fatigue and I get to do more than sleep and eat in the coming months. ",1738655740.0,1ihcpry
pregnant,Ways to exercise that aren't on your feet and are safe?,"It's hot AF summer where I am. I usually walk dogs for work but have had to stop due to heat and having such sore feet, and just generally being heavy and pregnant lol.

I've gone from 65kg pre pregnancy to 82kg now at 33 weeks. I'm not overly worried about how I am looking but kinda not loving my thighs as they are rubbing a lot in this heat and have gotten a little bigger.

I know swimming would be a great way to exercise, but I'm not a fan of the ocean and don't really have the money to lay for a public pool regularly. I do have this bike stand where I can ride whilst being stationary so I guess that could work.. 

Maybe some arobic stuff indoors where I am in front of the air con haha. Any suggestions welcome.",1738655515.0,1ihcnzl

pregnant,Delivery date and family events,"I‚Äôm feeling a bit anxious about my due date and some big family events happening around the same time. This is my second pregnancy, and with my first, I had a scheduled induction at 39 weeks, which went smoothly. This time, we have the added challenge of figuring out childcare for our daughter when I go into labor, plus my husband is the best man in a wedding a week after my due date.
	‚Ä¢	Due date: July 8
	‚Ä¢	July 6: My parents, who would be my first choice for childcare, are unavailable due to a family wedding. My in-laws can stay with us and watch our daughter, but for personal reasons, I‚Äôd really prefer not to come home from the hospital to my MIL.
	‚Ä¢	July 19: My husband is the best man in a wedding in Oregon (we live in San Francisco). He‚Äôs very close to the groom, and I‚Äôd love for him to be able to go. Our current plan is for him to fly out Friday night and return early Sunday morning. My mom would stay with me and help with both kids.

I‚Äôm considering a few options:
	‚Ä¢	Induction on July 1 (39 weeks): Baby would likely arrive by July 3, and I‚Äôd be home by the 5th. This would be cutting it close if labor takes longer or if I need extra time in the hospital, since we‚Äôd have to figure out childcare for the 6th. Also, baby could end up with a July 4 birthday‚Äînot a huge deal, but something I‚Äôve thought about.
	‚Ä¢	Induction on July 7: Baby would likely arrive by the 9th, and I‚Äôd be home by the 11th. This only gives us about a week before my husband leaves for the wedding, which feels a little tight.
	‚Ä¢	Let things happen naturally and accept my in-laws‚Äô help: Not my ideal choice, but it would ensure we have childcare in case I go into labor unexpectedly.

For those who have scheduled an induction or dealt with similar timing conflicts, what would you do? Any advice on balancing recovery, childcare, and making sure my husband can be there for the wedding? Would love to hear your experiences!",1738654383.0,1ihcf6e
pregnant,My coworkers favoritize one pregnant coworker over another,"So, For a back story I am a nurse at a clinic. mon-fri. I had a cryptic pregnancy and did not know until I was 4 months, told my manager because she needed to know to understand why I will be taking days off perioditicaly. 

Well while I was trying to grasp me being pregnant and my life turning upside down, said manager told EVERYONE when I did not ask her to. I let that go despite me being pissed off about it because it was not her place. 

She had me with a set provider who I was their nurse but due ti appointments she took me off that provider and told me Id be one of the call center nurses who answers the phone for the patients calling in. Which is more sitting down. 

Well, this was really to replace the lady who was permanant working there as she was out recovering from eye surgery. She comes back, now I am 34 weeks. High risk. And she puts me on Intake which is constant moving and walking around, like, consistent. Which wouldnt be an issue if my manager wasn‚Äôt ALSO pregnant. The issue is, when she and I were both doing it‚Äî all the staff was around her telling her she needs to sit down and how someone else shoukd be doing it for her. But then in the same scenerio, they leave me on intake consistently by myself with 150 pts coming in total all day. Getting vitals and rooming patients around the clock with no sit down time. It feels like more favoritism. They cater to her consistently as if we arent the same weeks pregnant, tell her she needs to rest, etc but then completely ignore me who is ALSO fucking tired, back hurting and cannot keep up. 

So while they cater to ONE pregnant person, threw her a baby shower, etc. I did not get that and also expected to be able to move around the same amount as a non pregnant person when I am infact 34+4 weeks. It boils my blood so much and there is infact less active positions that do not have permanant people on them and instead of understanding as someone who is also pregnant she caters to the ones who are not pregnant and kiss her ass. I‚Äôm not asking for my job to change everything for me but the fact that they cater and kiss the ass of one pregnant person and then leaves crumbs for the other makes me want to lose my sht on everyone and maybe thats hormones talking.

pregnant,"I finally graduated, my baby girl is here! (Positive hospital birth, induction)","I‚Äôve been on this sub since I found out I was pregnant last May. I‚Äôm so excited to share my birth story with y‚Äôall. This is copied from my notes app and was originally written to my MIL who wanted to know as much as I could remember so if it sounds pointed, that‚Äôs why. Note: Riley is my husbands name. 

We were admitted to the hospital at 6:00am and were set up in our room right away. My nurse checked me and I was 2-3cm dialated. My midwife decided to give me misoprostol and just let me chill. They monitored the baby and me until about 12. They checked and I was 4cm and then they started my pitocin drip. My contractions were pretty intense after that. My water broke during one of them and it was the craziest feeling! My contractions had become too intense to sit through so I was standing with Riley and squeezing his hands and swaying and then I felt a pop and a bunch of fluid came out, that was around 2:30. The nurse and midwife determined that baby girl had already had a bowel movement in utero but assured me not to freak out. I asked for an epidural and got that around 4. Honestly the epi was prefect bc the anesthesiologist was so quick at her job, I barely felt it. Basically only my lower torso/vagina was numb and I could still use my legs to position myself on the bed which was nice. 

They had me labor until around 9:30pm and I was dilated to 9/9.5cm. My nurse and midwife had me push and rest in a bunch of different positions for a few hours to see if I could make it all the way to 10cm. I would like push for 3-5 contractions, rest for the next few rounds then do it again. And then around midnight my midwife and the main doctor came in and they were like ‚Äúokay we‚Äôre here until she comes out‚Äù. The next three hours were like the most exhausting hours of my life and there were so many times where I honestly thought I physically wasn‚Äôt going to make it. My midwife knew I really didn‚Äôt want a c-section though and in hindsight she did a really good job keeping me pushing and motivated. There were times I was pushing so hard I had to vomit and that was intense. She let me reach down and feel the baby‚Äôs head starting to crown and that really helped me push through. I think about an hour before baby girl came out, my midwife changed into her full delivery gear and that was so encouraging lol bc I was like thank god it‚Äôs all coming to an end. Omg it was crazy to feel her come out though. Like even though I was numbed I still felt the pain of her whole head coming out. But I remember thinking ‚Äúokay this is the worst it will be, I can get her out now‚Äù and I felt so much relief her head passed and then I could feel her shoulders and everything else. The midwife put her right on my chest and it was so cool! Omg I‚Äôll never forget her warm, wet little body. I got to hug and kiss her and it was so cool and literally as soon as she was on me, I didn‚Äôt feel anymore pain or concept of time. Riley got to cut the cord and one of the nurses took a bunch of pics of that. 

They took her off me over to a different table and had to suction meconium out of her lungs. That was really scary bc even though her heart rate and oxygen level stayed in the healthy range, not hearing her cry was freaking me out. But after 2-3 round of suctioning she was moving around and crying. I was watching them work on her while my midwife delivered the placenta and gave me just a couple stitches. I felt the placenta come out bc she was massaging my stomach and I could feel that still but thank god I don‚Äôt feel the stitches at all. 

And yeah that was basically it. I started coming down from adrenaline and had a horrible migraine and I threw up more. They gave me something in my IV for nausea and a bunch of crackers and after that I felt incredible. They took out my epidural line and I was all cleaned up and tucked in bed. Overall, my first time birth experience was positive and I felt very cared for. And now my baby girl is resting in bed with me and it‚Äôs so crazy bc it feels like I‚Äôve always had her. I can‚Äôt imagine life without her sweet little face. ",1738653138.0,1ihc5b0

pregnant,3rd CSECTION MANDATORY??,"Today i (33f) am 31+4. The Military is paying for my prenatal and post natal care completely because I am 100%. This is my third child. My first in 2009 was induced a week early for no reason besides the dr wanted to and I was 17 so I agreed and after the drugs to speed up labor my sons heart rate fell. My daughter i had in 2014 and after I was given the epidural her heart rate fell. Both were emergency c sections. 

Today i asked my Dr at the appointment since I have had two c sections do I have to give birth as a c section? Or if can I at least attempt labor  one more last time on my own in 2025. He told me sternly no that the risk of uterine rupture is higher now. But I see as I google it's possible to try for one more VBAC after two csections... then he asked me if ill want my tubes tied and i absolutely do not. I actually ended up crying later on thinking about what to do..

My mom said she had a birth after two csections. They wanted her to come in for the c section but she just stayed home. I'm torn on what  to do. My husband and i want one more child.. I feel the Dr just wants to do it and not try because the VA will pay whatever. Idk if i should find another doctor this late or ignore him and not go in.. or just go get the csection and try one last time for a another baby by 35.

pregnant,Inlaws more involved than usual,"FTM married for 5 years together for 10. 38 weeks pregnant at the moment. 
Background: I have lovely inlaws, never had any issues whatsoever. They‚Äôve always kept a bit of distance and so have I. My husband also doesn‚Äôt have a very close relationship with them but it is a pleasant one. His father would call once or twice a month to check in and that‚Äôs about it unless he needs my husband for something else. 
Sister inlaw recently gave birth, baby is now 5 months old - has little to no relationship with her brother or I. Never bothered to message unless on birthdays. 

Problem: since finding out I am pregnant, sister inlaw has been messaging me asking about my pregnancy, basically checking in a couple of times a month. This is overwhelming as it has gone from no communication to her wanting updates on my appts, health and baby. 

My parents inlaw has also been checking in more frequently than usual with husband asking about baby and how pregnancy is going, which is fine because I don‚Äôt need or want them calling me. Every time we visit it‚Äôs always, ‚Äúthe baby can feel her baby cousin in your belly‚Äù, ‚Äúthey will be the terrible twins‚Äù 

I am frustrated. I feel like an incubator for them. As much as there has been no issues, there has also been no effort to make me feel included or a part of their family from the start. I feel like now that I am carrying their son‚Äôs DNA, my husband is good enough to be contacted more frequently and shown care and concern. 
Where was the effort all these years? 

My husband feels they are just trying to do their part as grandparents and are excited for another little one on the way. He also said he knows that the only reason they are now checking in more frequently is because of the pregnancy/baby and he is fully aware of it. 

I won‚Äôt keep my child from seeing any family members, but I feel as though, they have no relationship with me, lack of relationship with their son, and now they expect to have some kind of relationship with their grandbaby? 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being too harsh or just plain ignorant or what.

pregnant,SO caught cheating and I'm giving birth in two days. Do I allow him in the delivery room?,"I have a 15 month old and am delivering my second baby in two days. I have been working on my relationship with my SO for some time, meaning we are in couples therapy after I have given him multiple chances. I have dealt with lies, manipulations, gaslighting, etc. Too much to get into on here but I stayed so I wouldn't be a single mom of two and my kids would have a dad. I just found out he purchased tokens last night when he wasn't home on Chaturbate (a site for webcam girls). This is cheating to me. Spending money on sexual activities with other women.. on top of that, we have been struggling financially HARD! Ofc he tried manipulating and gaslighting me again into thinking its something other than the truth. I'm just broken. We were finally on a good path with a positive outlook on the future, or so I thought. Do I allow him in the delivery room? Do I put him on the birth certificate? It makes me so sad because he's such an amazing father, but clearly I don't deserve this and am beyond done.  A breakup means I am moving across the country to live with my family. I feel bad for the kids.

I will also add, we have barely had any sex this past year because of his libido/stress/health or whatever reason it is that month for him. Meanwhile, I have a very high sex drive, maintained my health and continued to go to the gym up until a week ago, bounced right back after my first baby... so there's no excuse for him to use regarding that.

One symptom I‚Äôve had throughout my pregnancy has been a lot of discharge, but I never thought anything of it because I knew it was a common symptom and I saw lots of people complaining about it. It‚Äôs never been accompanied by a foul odor, burning, itching, anything like that. 

About a month ago I wondered if I could have a yeast infection, after reading that it‚Äôs common for people to get during pregnancy. Monistat was approved by my OB to use, and after using it for a week, my discharge decreased in frequency/quantity. So I thought that was the end of it.

Well, I just recently decided to order some ph test strips for peace of mind, after reading a lot of posts on here about women leaking amniotic fluid. I tested, and received an abnormal reading. Not the darkest blue, but it ranked at ‚Äò5.0‚Äô on the ph scale.

Since then, I‚Äôve been freaking out about what it could mean, and read that it could be BV. I‚Äôm now absolutely sick with worry that I‚Äôve had it this entire time, and my baby could be in danger.

I got an epidural and I feel guilty about it. I had planned to go un medicated because I wanted to experience the beautiful miracle of childbirth. Little did I know it was going to be the single most hardest thing in my entire life. I was 40w4ds in and had to be induced because of my amniotic fluids being too low for the baby. I was then put on cytotec because I was only 1cm dilated. 

Once I took that pill every 4hrs, my body was immediately beginning to contract but at a very slow pace. Every 2hrs my cervix would dilate by 1cm each time and the pain began to be unbearable. I tried using every single thing the deter the pain. A birthing ball, a birthing comb, a warm shower, a TENS unit and my hospital didn‚Äôt have nitrous oxide. Once I‚Äôve reached about 5cm the contractions were closer apart and the pain was too much to handle that not even my birthing comb or my amazing coach/husband‚Äôs words could no longer help. This pain was just so.. unspeakably traumatic. I couldn‚Äôt think, i couldn‚Äôt eat. They gave me the option of morphine and some anxiety meds but those only did so much. I tried breathing techniques but, it was all.. just soul sucking. 

I can‚Äôt even remember how it all went down. The nurses had poked me about 6 times before having to call down their ‚ÄúIV Team‚Äù and those needles pokes were so painful. I used to be chill with needles. Now? I‚Äôm terrified. Poked like a pin cushion. By 5cm, I gave in. I could no longer hold out. I folded. I had the epidural on standby just incase it was all too much. They had also switched me from cytotec (pill) to the pitocin (iv fluid). Once I folded, I had requested the epidural. I kept telling myself the entire time that I could do this, but I was not ready for such pain. I wanted to keep away from the epidural because of the side effects I‚Äôve heard and read about. 

My husband was there with me supporting me along the way. Whom I am very fucking thankful for. He kept reassuring me that I was strong for doing what I was doing no matter what I wanted and that getting the epidural didn‚Äôt make me less of a woman. But truthfully. And honestly it does. I‚Äôm someone who loves adrenaline and adventure and am tomboyish, someone who‚Äôs always ambitious, like ‚ÄúBRING ON THE PAIN‚Äù so yes.. I got the epidural and it made me feel guilty. It made me feel less of a woman. My husband kept reassuring me that it didn‚Äôt make me less of anything and that I was strong through it all. When those epidural needles came in. I screamed in pain. As soon as epidural went in.. the pain was gone and all I felt was pressure. I‚Äôm glad I got the epidural but it made me feel inferior. Made me smaller. I wanted to push myself through it all but I just couldn‚Äôt. 

PLEASE DON‚ÄôT LET MY WORDS DISCOURAGE ANYONE please. 

Once I got the epidural.. everything changed. I was able to sleep. I was able to talk. I was able to enjoy my birth. I was in pain and in labor for 48 hours up until I got the epidural. I only pushed for 20 mins, and all I felt was pressure. Like If I had to poop. And it did suck a bit because I was not able to move and my hips hated me for being in one position for too long. But my baby boy was born Jan. 29 @ 8:43am. 8lbs 1oz! So yes.. this is me just ranting and venting, because I thought I could do it. I still feel guilty but happy my son came out safe and healthy.

I found out I was pregnant around my birthday in November of last year. This is our rainbow baby as I had a miscarriage in September. But I‚Äôve noticed during both pregnancies I‚Äôve been very irritable, cranky, starting to yell a bit more than usual / fight over the stupidest things. Obviously hormones have some play into this. I also have some back issues from a past injury which has been causing me a lot of pain recently.
The point of this post though, I don‚Äôt want to be touched, he‚Äôll give me a kiss and I just want him to leave me alone, his breath stinks, he stinks, when he touches me I get aggravated, when he doesn‚Äôt put things back in their ‚Äúhome‚Äù I want to ring his neck, he is just the bane of my existence but I LOVE THIS MAN.

pregnant,Please help!! I think my wife is depressed,"Hello I am husband and my wife is 4 months pregnant. She had a really rough 1st trimester. Throwing up not being able to eat or hold anything down. A lot of stomach pains and no energy.

She already has a daughter and we had one miscarriage right before this pregnancy.

I am not the best husband. I still have bad smoking habits and short tempers/ self interests in video games when I go home after long work days. I used to travel and go out but I don‚Äôt anymore and she doesn‚Äôt like to travel. 

She is also has a very good job and at one point I was making more moneys but now she is.

Once we got married I moved in with her and then we bought a new house together. She now doesn‚Äôt like the new house, certain rooms are triggers for her because she felt alone and I left her one night because I didn‚Äôt check on her  until 3-4 hours later.
She is very strong willed and has been. I try to lead this family but she has lost respect for me because of my bad habits and relaxed mindset when she can‚Äôt relax unless it‚Äôs clean or she feels safe. 

She says things like I‚Äôm gonna die cuz of this pregnancy , she doesn‚Äôt know if she wants to be with me, she is scared her water is gonna break early and that she regrets this /will never do it again.

I wanted more kids but not anymore. I‚Äôm started to feel depressed and all the hurtful things she has said are starting to weigh me down. 

We have an appointment tomorrow and my mom is coming, I‚Äôm gonna tell the doctor I think she might have depression even though my wife denies / says it‚Äôs all physical pain

I really think her mental pain and worry is making her physical pain worse. Is that crazy? Should I not say anything tomorrow? 

Women please help, what would you want to hear? How can I make it better? I need to be strong for my family ",1738645246.0,1iha3c8
pregnant,Nausea: Altitude related?,"16 weeks and super stumped about my nausea. I‚Äôve been having morning sickness nearly every day since about week 6. Last Sunday (week 15) I traveled to Mexico (Guadalajara) for a wedding and spent an amazing nausea-free week eating everything I hoped for AND kept it down (yay!). I was so relieved and thought maybe it was the end of nausea/vomiting. 
Unfortunately and to my surprise just a few hours back where I live (Nashville), I‚Äôm experiencing the symptoms all over again :‚Äô)

Someone in Mexico was surprised to hear I‚Äôd no symptoms of nausea while visiting and  thought it might be due to altitude. My husband and I are so puzzled and now we‚Äôre just trying to figure out if anyone knows anything about this or have had similar experiences?!

Googling only mentions altitude sickness may be confused with morning sickness but this would be inverse altitude sickness? (Is that even a thing?) 

For context: Guadalajara is 5,138 ft above sea level and Nashville is 597 ft above sea level

pregnant,How to tell my sister I‚Äôm pregnant,"I‚Äôm 7 weeks and found out I‚Äôm pregnant very early, but my husband and I wanted to wait to tell my family and close friends, but we decided to wait to tell his parents because we‚Äôve had some run ins with them in the past and I‚Äôm not to thrilled to tell them anytime sooner than probably 14 weeks. 

Anyways, my sister and I are very close and I really want to tell her sooner rather than later. We are planning on traveling to where my family and our friends live in a few weeks so we can tell them in person, but I have a couple reasons to want to tell my sister first/separate from the rest. 

1. She‚Äôs my best friend, we are really close and from the moment I saw the 2nd line come up, I wanted to call her and tell her. 

2. She had an abortion a little over a year ago and really struggled with coming to terms with her decision after that. I want to give her space to react and feel any feelings she might feel when I tell her. I don‚Äôt want her to feel the pressure to react a certain way if we were to tell her at the same time as my parents. 

So, how do you think I can do it? I always thought of doing something special for when I tell her but I don‚Äôt want to go overboard after everything that happened. 

When we talked about me having a baby after what she went through (I asked her if she wanted to be involved and if it was okay that I tell her and all that), she said of course she wants to know and she‚Äôll be excited, and that she‚Äôll be fine and will love and protect my baby, that I shouldn‚Äôt worry about her, but she‚Äôs still my little sister and I want to protect her feelings as much as I can.

pregnant,Maternity clothes,"I‚Äôm a 20 y/o FTM (18 weeks pregnant), and my pants do not fit. Pre pregnancy I was a size xs/s. Of course all of my clothes are tight/form fitting and mainly crop tops. Half of my clothes are either baggy band tee‚Äôs or club tops. I don‚Äôt have a mature style, I‚Äôm 20 lol. Anyways, I have a total of two sweats that fit comfortably and one pair of low rise baggy jeans I can wear. Everything else is wayyyy too tight. 

Today, I mentally broke down over it and started cutting up a pair of sweats that didn‚Äôt fit (thinking I could take the seam apart and elastic out- I couldn‚Äôt and my emotions got the best of me). My poor fianc√© runs out of the shower to see me crying on our bed with cut up sweats on and scissors in my hands. He calmed me down and took me maternity shopping. We went to maurice‚Äôs and walked through the whole store not seeing a single ‚Äúmaternity‚Äù sign. An employee eventually came up to us and when asked about maternity clothes she gave me a very sad/sympathetic look and said ‚Äúi‚Äôm so sorry but this is all we have‚Ä¶‚Äù one rack. One rack, with a total of 6 pants. Both in a XXL (skinny jeans and pleather pants). She recommended we go to target as they have a bigger section. 

We‚Äôre at target. Looked in every section and again- couldn‚Äôt find anything labeled ‚Äúmaternity‚Äù or any pregnant mannequins. I started crying in the middle of store and had to step out for a few moments before returning back. We went over to the clearance section (it was a mess, clothes and hangers everywhere and no space to walk in between the racks) and right next to it was the maternity section. This time, two racks. Skinny jeans, pleather pants, jeggings, cheetah print shirts, shirts with ‚Äúmama‚Äù on it, just all around ugly clothes. My fianc√© and I just laughed. Eventually I gave up and got a pair of sweats that looked big enough for me to comfortably wear and we went to Goodwill. 

Goodwills selection was the biggest, but of course had only outdated clothes from the early 2000‚Äôs and 10‚Äôs. So again, just picked out clothes that were a size larger with no elastic band. 

We also went to Walmart. Same as target. 

We live in a small town right now and those are literally the only stores we have besides a couple of boutiques and thrift shops‚Ä¶ 

What young mom wants to wear any of these ugly maternity clothes? Or just moms in general? The cutest thing was a plain black dress (I hate dresses/skirts). I want to be able to wear my comfy sweats but also dress up when I feel like it. I‚Äôm so frustrated! It‚Äôs like the clothing industry thinks pregnant people don‚Äôt exist.

pregnant,Why Can't I get an RSV shot,"I am a husband in the USA and my wife's midwife practice recommended that I get an RSV vaccination to help protect my soon to be son. (also recommended anyone that will be around the baby a lot in the first months should get it) I am happy to get the shot so I asked my primary care doctor if I could get it there and also a pharmacy nearby and they both said it isn't approved for young, non-pregnant people who don't have other risk factors. My Primary care doctor told me that it would be great if I could get it, but that they aren't approved to provide it to me. But that he is able to write a prescription for it. The pharmacy said they wouldn't even accept a presciption for it and wouldn't give me the shot.

I was asking my doctor's secretary on the phone about why it is not approved, ie risks not outweighing benefits, lack of supply, but she made it clear that all she could say was that it wasn't approved for me, but that my doctor thinks I should keep trying to get it.

Does anyone know why this vaccine is so hard to get, and does anyone have any pointers about how to get it? If its this hard for the father to be to get this vaccine IDK how the midwife practice expects anyone else who is seeing the baby to get it!",1738637564.0,1ih7qvz

pregnant,This is the dumbest question I think I've ever asked.ü§£,"Is ""pregnancy nose"" actually a thing? Some women seem get it and some women don't.

I've seem numours videos of women being like ""pregnancy nose is no joke!"" And showing pictures of them before pregnancy and then pictures of them heavily pregnant and their noses are absolutely huge.

One thing I do notice though, is usually in the before pictures, they're all dolled up wearing a lot of makeup, and in the heavily pregnant pics, they're not wearing any makeup. And I can't figure out if:

1. They're just showing their contoured nose, using makeup in their before pics, which makes their nose appear smaller. And without makeup they've probably just always had a big nose, but they're trying to say *pregnancy nose*  is a thing even though it isn't? And they might just be doing it for views?


Or


2. It's actually a thing? Your nose, for some reason, grows and looks massive in later pregnancy?


I'm confused haha.

I‚Äôm(28F) 28 weeks pregnant with my 22 (M) boyfriends child, when he‚Äôs sober, he‚Äôs everything I want in a partner, co-parent etc, but he is a fisherman that spends about half the year long distance.

He‚Äôs made some mistakes while on these hiatus‚Äôs and has quit for a few weeks at a time because he says he wants to be better not just for me but for our child, but as I‚Äôm a person who watches for action over words, he‚Äôs recently started doing all that heavily again. He talks constantly how he doesn‚Äôt want to be doing it and knows it‚Äôs bad, he‚Äôll ‚Äúbe done by the time baby gets here‚Äù but I‚Äôm just so nervous over the fact that if he hasn‚Äôt started to quit now that it might not change even after we have a baby. 

I love him so much, and I watch him hurting himself and throwing away this beautiful life we could have, but he just wants to ‚Äúrelax‚Äù and numb himself every time he has some time off from fishing and he‚Äôs with his very influential coworkers. 

Do I stick around waiting? Do I throw ultimatums at him? Should I just fly home and start planning on a life with my baby and without him? I hate that my baby can feel all my emotions and feel what I‚Äôm going through but I feel if I step away now I‚Äôll just feel worse and put that much more strain on the baby.

I have a rather large fibroid as well and I asked her if that was impacting it and she didn‚Äôt seem convinced.

I‚Äôm schedule for an ultrasound in 3ish weeks at the hospital which freaks me out but I might ask her if I can get in sooner because my anxiety is through the roof. 

My gestational diabetes test was normal.

She said it could just be a big baby, maybe excessive amniotic fluid which could indicate a problem where the baby isn‚Äôt swallowing the amniotic fluid like he should be and I‚Äôm panicking.

I‚Äôm 41 today and this is my IVF miracle and likely my only chance.

Anyone have any perspectives for me so I can at least get through the night before I call my midwife tomorrow?",1738628407.0,1ih4ktn

pregnant,Switching OBs 14+3 - refusing to send my records,"I‚Äôm currently in the process of switching my OB. Long story short, when I initially found out I was pregnant, my insurance wouldn‚Äôt cover my preferred affiliated OB. Fast forward a bit and I‚Äôm covered again. 

I went into this thinking it was meant to be with my first OB - it was close enough to home, schedules were flexible like mine..etc. I have had previous health issues regarding AST/ALT and liver problems in the past, as well as anemia which I kept reminding my OB of when I saw those were not tested in my panel. My last set of labs was on 11+3 and I figured I‚Äôd get a call to discuss once the abnormalities in my test inevitably showed up. They did because he finally ran the tests I suggested. I called, it‚Äôs been well over two weeks - no response. 

I reached out to my liver team and PCP and they finally got me into an OB affiliated with them so I have a literal team of doctors within the same hospital network to see when I need to. I‚Äôm going tomorrow for my first OB session, and as such, I asked the initial OB for a copy of my records, labs, charts etc. honestly, I have no interest in stepping foot in this persons office again (lack of communication, has yet to put a Doppler on my stomach, hasn‚Äôt checked my BP, hasn‚Äôt weighed me, was never available to answer US questions - last one was at 6+6, and I‚Äôm not scheduled until March for my anatomy scan). 

They refused to send my chart, labs, etc. until I go in with them AGAIN. Is this normal?! I‚Äôm floored. I have never had anyone refuse me my med records. Not to mention, I offered to pay any processing fee. Offered to pick them up and scan them myself, still refused.

Ended up calling my doctor and sleeping at 4am. Long story short, I went to the ER at 9am and got a bunch of checks and they don't know what's causing it, but can only advise hydrating.

I have no other symptoms. Peeing every 10 minutes because I'm chugging water. No bleeding, closed cervix, healthy baby (measuring 18 weeks). Urine was fine and no yeast infection. 

I'm just so tired from the constant cramps. Sometimes they're fine, but sometimes I can't walk, can't talk, hitting a bump while driving back from ER while having a cramp was a nightmare. They last about 5-10 seconds each time. They've been consistently 5 minutes apart since yesterday night.

He's 29 and I feel like his family too would be thrilled and more than helpful, I however do not want to say that. I think about how my life will change and how little I still feel but I'm also again twenty six and not that little. Young enough sure but i'm not a teenager or in my early twenties anymore.

It all started because she was very optimistic at the start of this pregnancy, and that annoyed me because I had JUST gone through a miscarriage and wanted to be realistic. So anything positive she said I basically followed up with the extreme negative alternative. Ie she says ‚ÄúI have a feeling the baby is going to be perfect and healthy‚Äù and I respond ‚Äúok but what if I have a feeling it‚Äôs already dead.‚Äù Like an emo teenager.

Now I‚Äôm in a ‚Äúsafer‚Äù zone, I‚Äôm still struggling to not be negative to her. She asks how I‚Äôm doing, and I basically just dump all my fears and bad feelings on her.

Found out I was pregnant in early January and it hasn‚Äôt been smooth sailing. Last week I ended up in the ER with heart palpitations, high BP, and this feeling of adrenaline / warmth which was horrible. It felt like an anxiety attack but it was much different as I absolutely couldn‚Äôt get my heart rate to calm down. They did a ton of tests and ultimately found that my thyroid levels are off (I already take meds for hypothyroidism) and also found sinus tachycardia (which is basically just a fast heart rate). They prescribed me a beta blocker and it brought everything down which did give me some relief, but ultimately referred me to endocrinologist and cardiologist. In the last few days I‚Äôve developed this weird chest pain in my left breast and needless to say, I‚Äôve been spiraling. In the hospital they ruled out DVT (blood clot) and they also did cardiac labs which were normal. Basically I need to see the cardiologist to truly rule out stuff and then see endocrinologist to get my thyroid levels on track. The ER visit truly traumatized me as it felt like I was completely out of control of my body. Given I‚Äôm in a waiting game until those appointments (albeit I do have the Beta blocker if I need it), I just haven‚Äôt been able to distract myself from it all.

i also feel like my friends have made almost zero effort to hang out with me or constantly cancel plans which i then see them hanging out with their other friends constantly. i don‚Äôt have much time before im a mom that ill be able hang out with no worries. this all feels like such a stupid thing to worry about and be sad about.

I work at an office 32 hours a week and I use a day off to go to school. And the weekends, I rest but I usually end up doing homework and house chores on those days. At first I was being optimistic about going to school while Im pregnant, but now I am having second thoughts. Especially because I don't qualify for financial aid since Im a part time student, and I am paying out of pocket for my education. My boyfriend has a lot of financial burdens at the moment, but he does want to join the union and pay those off as soon as possible before the baby comes. I am having trouble making a decision on whether I should Withdraw from school in order to save some money and second, because Im worried that If I am too stressed during my pregnancy It will affect the baby. 

I know people say that the pregnancy symptoms get better in the second trimester but I'm not sure how it will go for me.

If Im being honest a part of me still want to go to university, because Ive had this schedule and done this before I was pregnant and it wasn't that bad. I passed my two classes with A‚Äôs. But they were beginning classes and the professor said that this semester will be a little more challenging. 


The last cherry on top of all of this, is that my university has a deadline for 100% the refund if you withdraw and that date has already passed. Meaning that if I withdraw now I will only get 50% of my money back. Which I think is very unfair due to the fact that its only been 3 weeks since the semester started‚Ä¶.
I could possibly get a total refund If I submit an appeal but it is not 100% certain that they will approve it.

pregnant,Am I ungrateful or justified with feelings for baby gift?,"I‚Äôm currently 34+2 and I‚Äôm getting so excited to meet our little girl in a few weeks. 

In regards to baby stuff and items, my partner and I have been sorted for months. We were really fortunate that we have a few friends that have had children and couldn‚Äôt wait to give us stuff they had used and no longer needed, which gave them space and saved us money. So much so that when sending invitations out for our baby shower which is this weekend coming, we‚Äôve said we don‚Äôt need anything but if people would like to get us or the baby a gift to just provide vouchers such as Amazon as there‚Äôs nothing we need. 

When I was 13w, my Mum bought us the pram and travel set. It‚Äôs tradition here (UK) for the maternal grandmother to buy the pram, and she was so excited and I absolutely love it. It means a lot to me as she doesn‚Äôt have a lot of money, but wanted to buy it for us. 

Now onto the issue. 

Partner has a friend (A) who is in a relationship and is engaged to this awful woman (B). They‚Äôve split up about 20 times, each time with A complaining to us about the next awful thing B has said and done and then they get back together. The last time this happened B said some really hurtful things about me being pregnant (to A, not me or my partner) which A relayed to us and justified it saying it‚Äôs because B can‚Äôt have children. I had enough and blocked B from everything because not only was she an awful person to A, but now she was saying stuff about me and my baby. 

B then apologised for her behaviour to my partner and I, and for A‚Äôs sake we forgave her. I‚Äôm very much ‚Äòforgive but don‚Äôt forget‚Äô with certain things, especially this. 

Ever since this, B has tried to be overly involved with my pregnancy. Saying how she can‚Äôt wait to look after her, be an ‚Äòauntie‚Äô etc. B is not my friend, nor would I consider her to be one so I find this uncomfortable and she has another thing coming if she thinks she‚Äôs being left alone with my child! 

So yesterday, A and B tell us they can‚Äôt come to the baby shower but they have got us a gift. 

B has bought us a pram and travel set that they brought to our house (they knew we already had one)

Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs very nice. But I have some issues with it. 

1) Why would you buy someone such a personal gift without consulting them? I wouldn‚Äôt even buy my best friend this gift without asking them?

2) She also got me some breast milk container bags. I‚Äôm not breastfeeding, so if you‚Äôre not close enough to me to know if I‚Äôm breast feeding or not then why would you think you‚Äôre close enough to buy an entire pram set??

3) I feel like she‚Äôs trying to ‚Äòbuy‚Äô our friendship. She has a huge history of buying and paying for things and then throwing it in A‚Äôs face.

I really don‚Äôt want to come across like I‚Äôm being ungrateful, I accept it‚Äôs a nice thing to do. I just find it all very bizarre and unnecessary especially when I don‚Äôt know her well enough. ",1738614179.0,1igyxsi

I took the five day course and during it all, my blood sugar numbers were a bit elevated (I have gestational diabetes) I had some nausea and fatigue, little bit of sore throat. I‚Äôm assuming what I was feeling was either the very blunted effect of the Flu or side effects of Tamiflu, maybe both. Two days after finishing the course of tamiflu, I‚Äôm feeling nauseated and a bit off. Could this still be from the flu? The Tamiflu? Any insight? ",1738614166.0,1igyxkf

pregnant,200+ FHT at 36&6,"At my (30 f) 36weeks and 6 days prenatal appointment with my midwife, my baby had a heart rate of 205-210. It would randomly drop down to her baseline 140ish for a moment then shoot back up for a couple minutes. We went for a NST and BPP with no change. They gave me an IV to rule out dehydration. They did a full panel, everything came back normal/ healthy. This all was over the course of 5ish hours. Baby was active the whole time. She passed BPP except she didn't ""practice breathe"" for very long. So everything was ok except fast heart rate. The midwife, nurses, Dr., and high risk Dr. were all stumped at what the cause might be. Ultimately it was decided that baby needed to come out. High risk doctor recommended I stay the night and have a c-section in the morning. The other doctor suggested in the meantime we induce labor and try for a vaginal delivery. Baby came fast and smooth with the induction. C-section didn't happen.  my baby didn't pink up fast enough after delivery, ended up in the NICU for 6 days. Her heart is healthy, heart rate never went up again after her birth. NICU doctors told us her stay was because she was (slightly) premature and her lungs needed more time. My daughter is now 6 months old and perfectly healthy. I'm just looking for people who have had similar experiences with fast fetal heart rates, and what happened. Did it eventually just go back to normal, were you induced, c-section, was baby healthy??

This got my MIL and I talking about breastfeeding, and I said ""hopefully I won't need the formula if I can breast feed as much as possible,"" to which my MIL shared that she could only breast feed for a few months before resorting to formula because it was too difficult, and that she knows a lot of women who just don't have a milk supply after only a couple of months. She assured me that it's ok to not breast feed and that formula is enough, and it's not worth my mental health to ""guilt feed"" my baby if I'm not up to it.

So, to mothers who never used formula, how difficult was it? And, to mothers who tried and found that it was too much and resorted to bottle feeding, what was difficult about it?

So tomorrow puts me at 37 weeks and I had an appointment with my doctor today. From what I was told either route whether natural or c section will have its risk especially with the way I tore last time. However, she stated due to how young and healthy me and baby are that the risks are minimal. 

I told her to just put me down for a c section for now and I have the appointment set at 39 weeks BUT I‚Äôm still struggling with making that choice.

Husband and I are super happy and excited for our baby‚Äôs arrival, and for any of the discomforts during pregnancy (nausea, etc) - I‚Äôm lucky I‚Äôm even here to experience them when it was so hard to get pregnant before.

Now that my bump is noticeable and I‚Äôve announced to close friends, family and coworkers that I‚Äôm expecting, I‚Äôve had a few people say things like:
- ‚ÄúEnjoy your sleep now, coz you won‚Äôt get any when baby arrives‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThis is your future‚Äù- said by a couple friend we had lunch with at a restaurant as they struggled with their squirmy baby in the high chair and had to take turns eating while the partner holds the baby
- ‚ÄúWe had to wake up every hour last night bc baby wouldn‚Äôt sleep‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWait til you deal with the poop blowouts while you figure out which formula works for your baby‚Äù

I get that these are real things that people deal with when baby arrives but is there a point to being so negative and scaring me of the prospect of motherhood when my husband and I struggled to get there? 

Just want to hear your thoughts and experiences.

pregnant,How to politely tell your dad to leave you alone because he‚Äôs stressing you out,"So this will be my first kid and since I‚Äôm the oldest child, this is also going to be their first  grandchild so I completely understand their excitement. However, my dad is just‚Ä¶ so weird‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs socially awkward and doesn‚Äôt really have a filter, but he means well. He can make me quickly uncomfortable by rubbing my bump in weird ways after I tell him politely to stop, calls my daughter his baby that he can‚Äôt wait to ‚Äúhug kiss love and spoil‚Äù, and asks a lot of personal questions that I‚Äôd prefer not to answer. I‚Äôm currently 39 weeks pregnant and one of the qs he‚Äôs asked me is how soon will he know when she‚Äôs born and when will he be able to see her? I‚Äôm genuinely not comfortable for anyone to see her as soon as she‚Äôs born and would like to wait at least 2 months before anyone sees her, but I have a feeling that it‚Äôs an unrealistic goal, especially with my parents. Today he sent me a text that said ‚ÄúGood morning my daughter. My baby. How are you feeling this morning? Anything new? I will be checking on you every day since you‚Äôre close to the finish line. Love Dad‚Äù he sometimes uses terms like ‚Äúmy love‚Äù ‚Äúbabygirl‚Äù and ‚Äúbaby‚Äù to address me in texts which has always made me uncomfortable but anyways..
I see him and my mom multiple times a week (more than I‚Äôd like to) and he makes it seem like it‚Äôs been weeks since I last saw him. For some reason, this just stresses me out and I don‚Äôt know why. Im definitely grateful that he is so supportive and excited for my baby‚Äôs arrival, but it just seems so overbearing. It‚Äôs to the point that my mom has caught on how I‚Äôve felt and tries to shut him down when he‚Äôs about to ask a weird question or saying something that‚Äôs weird, but my dad will try to catch me alone to ask qs he knows he either won‚Äôt get an answer to or I don‚Äôt have the answer to, which makes me less likely to want him close to my daughter so soon. I‚Äôve given everyone the same rules about when they‚Äôll get to see my daughter, but he (and slightly my mom) is the only one that seems to have a problem with it. Am I overreacting? How do I tell him just to back off because I will update when I‚Äôm able and when it‚Äôs needed? I understand he‚Äôs excited but he can‚Äôt seem to register that I‚Äôm already stressed and it doesn‚Äôt help that I have to text my weird dad every 5 min about no updates while he‚Äôs asking inappropriate questions lol.

They said they couldn‚Äôt do a ‚Äúdating ultrasound‚Äù until two weeks from now, and that they won‚Äôt be doing any genetic testing until at least a month from now.

I‚Äôm 41 years old and I‚Äôm worried about Down‚Äôs syndrome.  I‚Äôm in a red state and would need to travel if I wanted to terminate the pregnancy (my state won‚Äôt perform abortions, but they haven‚Äôt made it illegal to travel out of state).   Also worried about this federal abortion ban (although who knows whether/when that will pass). 

I‚Äôm not saying I would definitely terminate the pregnancy if the baby had some genetic disorder.  But, given the increased risk of DS associated with my age, the fact that I‚Äôm in law school, and on the point of academic probation (for unrelated reasons, I had a mental health crisis ‚Äî I‚Äôm much better now but my GPA is shit and I will not be able to graduate if I don‚Äôt get at least a ‚ÄúB‚Äù average this semester), and the fact that I would be raising this baby with limited help from the father, I feel like I need to complete genetic testing as I possibly can, so I have time to decide how to proceed, should that issue arise. 

I felt kind of frustrated that the doctor‚Äôs office didn‚Äôt seem to view the whole thing urgently.  I was wondering if anyone else has any experience with this issue?  Should I call them back and express my concerns?  Is there any way to get that testing done elsewhere? 

I know that the earliest you can get it done is 10 weeks.  So it‚Äôs too early.  But I don‚Äôt want to wait another month or more to do it, if that can be avoided.

pregnant,How did you decide on a practice for your prenatal care?,"I have all my doctors (and records) with one institution - let's call it Big Hospital. I went outside of that institution for prenatal care because I wanted a hospital that was slightly closer (let's call it Mid Hospital). But I learned that none of my health records are shared across these two, which is frustrating. I liked that at Big Hospital all my doctors were with the same institution and all my records could be seen by all the doctors. The hospital for Mid Hospital I would deliver at is slightly closer (by about 10 minutes) and has rave reviews but a Level 3 NICU. Big Hospital has a Level 4 hospital, but is 10 minutes farther, and if I stayed with them all my health records would be in one place. Because it's a large institution, I don't actually know if my delivery doctor would be someone I ever meet (I need to check on this) because they have several locations where you can be seen for prenatal care but then everyone delivers at the same location.

In other words, what helped you decide? Did you go to see the hospitals you were delivering at? Was proximity more important than NICU level? Did you try to keep in one ""system"" for easy recordkeeping? If you switch, how far along were you when you did and did you find that difficult?

pregnant,So frustrated and confused - no idea if I am making the right the choice.,"I am currently just about 9 weeks pregnant with my second. I went to my midwife for my first appointment and the medical assistant told me to provide a urine sample for a pregnancy test. My son (16 months) and husband were at the appointment and I could hear my son screaming for me so I quickly peed in the cup without doing a clean catch because I didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal - no one told me they were going to send the urine for a culture. 

Well two days later I get a message on my patient portal that I have a UTI - 60000-100000 cfus of aerococcus urinae (which is really only an opportunistic found in elderly catheterized patients) . The nurse tells me to pick up a script for macrobid. I called the office today and said I don‚Äôt believe it the sample is totally accurate because I didn‚Äôt provide a clean catch. In addition, I saw the collection time for a sample was 4pm when I provided it at 10am so I am unsure if the sample was just sitting around for hours on end before it arrived at the lab. I told her yesterday I went to an urgent care to repeat the culture and urinalysis. The microscope urinalysis was completely clean but of course the culture is still in process . She agreed that we can wait for the other culture before starting the antibiotics. 

I have struggled with severe vulvodynia for years and was misdiagnosed initially with chronic UTIs . It was a traumatic time because my marriage suffered, my Crohn‚Äôs disease flared severely due to the antibiotics I was on constantly, and I underwent a lot of invasive exams which was hard due to a past assault.  This has brought back all the bad memories and I am so angry the medical assistant didn‚Äôt tell me they were going to do a culture so I wouldn‚Äôt have spiraled like this. 

I just would like to know if this happened to others too. I am so scared because I have anxiety that maybe I somehow do have a UTI and I am possibly increasing my risk of miscarriage by waiting for the other culture‚Äôs results. The other part of me wants to wait for confirmation since I know a Crohn‚Äôs flare could hurt my baby too.

pregnant,I hate my pets now,"38 weeks and I‚Äôve been dealing with this since the first trimester. My husband and I adopted two very affectionate cats two years ago. Other than basic cat issues, I never had an issue with them. 

Once I was pregnant though, I had a very immediate and intense hatred for them. I don‚Äôt know what it is, but it does make me feel guilty. I don‚Äôt like the way they smell, the sound of them grooming or eating triggers a rage response in my brain, I don‚Äôt want them sitting on or near me. 

One of the cats is exceptionally food driven and will not fuck off. He breaks glasses trying to find food on them, he will jump on a hot stove to try to get to the food, he will scratch and scream at the pantry door for hours. He‚Äôs bitten me multiple times simply because I had the smell of food on me, not even eating near him. I especially hate this cat currently. 

Yea, we did take him to the vet and they said it‚Äôs behavioral. He was like this before the pregnancy, but I‚Äôm now exceptionally tired of the sound of him screaming and pawing at things and cleaning up glass because one of us did the human action of forgetting to leave an empty glass of water next to the sink. We can‚Äôt reuse cups because of him. 

I hate them both now, though. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs just hormonal and I can go back to having them sleep on my feet at night. But for now, I don‚Äôt want anything to do with them. I hate their little crossed eyes, hate their little toe beans that I used to squish, hate. I avoid having contact with them. I don‚Äôt pick them up anymore, I lock them out of the bedroom, and when one of them tries to forcibly jump on me I set them down about ten times before they finally get the hint to walk away.

I had never seen one before IRL so I had no idea. I had previously throughout the years told him and his family and that they should be taking care of the issue, he always brushes it off saying yes he will. The story I got was that his uncle bought a speaker from the thrift store and that's how they arrived.

pregnant,Should I get an ultrasound?,"I‚Äôm 26 year old and had a blighted ovum back in August 2024 (first pregnancy).

pregnant,Sharing my story so far - Baby finally moved out of transverse position to head down at 34 weeks and I feel like I have my life back.,"A few days ago my baby girl (34weeks, first time) moved from a transverse position (sideways) to head down and I can now see how some women can lead normal, mobile, functioning lives while pregnant.

I have been mostly bed ridden (when not working) with pelvic girdle pain, symphysis pubic dysfunction, and severe sciatica in both legs since week 26 of this pregnancy. I am an average sized person and have gained 40lbs since far this pregnancy, mostly belly. Everything has been normal except for the hell of this pain in my lower body.

The pain has left me in tears of agony and made me a shell of myself. My husband has been my rock and given me all the physical and emotional support I could ever hope for. I have been physically fit and a hobby body builder for 15 years. I'm strong. I love being strong. This pain has humbled me. 

I have questioned why I have had such a horrible time when other women have loved pregnancy. I have felt so weak, frail, and like I have had nothing good to say about being pregnant. I have been unable to take walks, work out, or do much outside of my home. I can hardly walk up and down the stairs. An hour of grocery shopping without an electric cart takes me out for two days. I have carefully managed and supported healthy bowel moments my entire pregnancy and recently got to the point where nothing was working. The pressure from being unable to pass gas was unbearable when it was so regular for most of the pregnancy. The baby had just gotten too big at this point. I could not even lay on my side, only my back.

Last Thursday night I was writhing in pain in bed from sciatica when the pain disappeared. I spent a few hours catching my breath and bracing myself for it to return. I slept through the night for the first time in ages and woke up feeling mobile and aside from a tender hamstring (from weeks of sciatic nerve inflammation), the pain was gone. It felt miraculous. I cried again.

Later on Saturday night the pain returned. I was absolutely devastated and cried myself to sleep. I had SUCH a productive day - I was truly nesting!!! I accomplished so much. I knew I wasn't in pain from over doing it - I could feel baby girl was sideways again.

I woke up Sunday morning around 4am and spent several hours gently cupping her in my belly hoping it would encourage her to shift. I stayed in downward dog, opened my chest, and kept my abdomen as stretched as comfortably possible to give her room.

She DID move back into position and I had another day of productivity and although I knew she could shift at any time, she is still head down. I am praying she stays this way until birth.

No one warned me about this. I have expressed my pain as 9/10 to my OB (I truly have a high pain tolerance) several times and they offered ZERO advice or information. I have stretched/done yoga when possible, bounced on the ball, used the pillows, Tylenol did nothing, I'm seeing a chiropractor (new to me.) nothing worked. All it took was baby moving. If I had known that may offer some relief, I would have been mentally in a much better place.

If you are suffering from debilitating pain like this, please at least consider that it may be baby's position. I wish I had known. I have spent weeks in a really difficult place and it had clouded my optimism and stolen so much joy from me. I am so grateful for a healthy baby and glad she made this milestone.

babybumps,Phantom pregnancy.,"So I have 2 kids. A toddler and a baby. Baby is 8 months old and I exclusively breastfeed her. I got my period back at 5 months postpartum and haven‚Äôt had one since, I‚Äôm assuming because with my breastfeeding it‚Äôs normal for everything to be irregular. A few weeks ago I began noticing some weird symptoms, the most unsettling one being that I out of no where started feeling what feels like fetal movement. It doesn‚Äôt feel like gas. I put my hand on my lower abdomen and can feel movement. It‚Äôs became increasing in frequency. Other odd thing is that since I‚Äôm breastfeeding I hadn‚Äôt been able to put on weight. Some women can‚Äôt lose weight while breastfeeding, but I haven‚Äôt been able to put on weight. I recently decided to replace our scale batteries after I noticed that my clothes is fitting me weird and realized that I have gained 8 pounds. My milk supply has also decreased. It tanked pretty good about 3 months ago (AFTER my first pp period ended), and it‚Äôs been slowly but steadily decreasing (i exclusively breastfeed but also pump because my goal is to pump so I can get her to 1 and quit breastfeeding as soon as I have enough milk in the freezer). I have taken multiple pregnancy tests, they‚Äôre all negative. I KNOW I‚Äôm not pregnant but I am so distraught by the weight gain and weird movement in my abdomen. I‚Äôm finding myself having a hard time ignoring all of this. Has anyone been through this? Do I just have to live my life with these weird symptoms? Do I get in touch with a psychiatrist, lol?

I eat like an average person, not too much but enough (in a range of 2500 calories), eat junk food from time to time but not everyday. 

Now at 19 weeks I‚Äôve already gained 7 kilos (15 lbs) since the beginning of the pregnancy and my OBGYN literally shouted at me after I said that I don‚Äôt see any reason for dieting because I eat and look exactly the same as I used to before pregnancy (except the belly growth obviously). She said I‚Äôm acting irresponsible and I have only 4 kilos to gain otherwise there‚Äôll be problems. That means since now on I should gain only the weight of the baby itself and nothing more!
By the way I have no swelling, no high blood pressure or any problems with blood sugar, also I do not have a history of excess weight. All the test are normal and the baby is perfectly fine.

babybumps,I'm running out of nausea-safe options,"I've been surviving one day at a time, basically. What was the only safe thing to eat one day is what makes me puke the next one (and then I create an aversion I hope isn't for life).
Water was the first ship to sail. Eggs and crackers next. Then bread, pasta,  hummus, kiwi.
My most recent aversion now is lemons (which I love, please tell me this will pass). Last week I started having hot water with lemon every morning and they would hold my nausea all day long. I was finally happy to conquer nausea and have a safe option to hydrate and have some calories. Nothing could stop me now! Then, yesterday, while drinking lemonade I thought ""huh, this is not making me feel so good"".

Today I‚Äôm 8+5. I had an ultrasound on 8+1 and everything looked good.

I previously had a MMC so I‚Äôm super anxious that this is a sign of something bad. I keep thinking that it must be too early in the first trimester to feel better.

babybumps,Dreading weird maternity leave situation,"Let me start by saying I love my job, look forward to returning to it after my leave is over, and am so grateful to have the flexibility and leave options that I do. But I'm feeling so anxious and overwhelmed and I just need to vent.

I‚Äôm a FTM due at the end of March - currently 32 weeks and all the fatigue and discomfort of the third trimester is really starting to hit me. I‚Äôm a tenure-track professor and per my contract only teach fall and spring semesters, but my college has a winter session as well which means the spring semester doesn‚Äôt start until mid-February. If I had known I was pregnant any sooner I would have asked to teach the winter session so I could just buy myself out of teaching this spring, but that wasn‚Äôt possible so here we are. I have had almost two months off and just as I‚Äôm getting supremely uncomfortable and exhausted in late pregnancy I have to go back to teaching for a few weeks, with the plan that I will teach for the final six weeks of my pregnancy up until I give birth to maximize my paid maternity leave.

My maternity leave is paid off of sick time and I have only accrued four weeks - I can take up to a year off unpaid but for financial reasons we‚Äôre really trying to avoid unpaid time off if at all possible, so the challenge was to try and stretch those 20 days to cover the remaining 10 weeks of the semester. What I worked out with my department chair is that I will teach my courses hybrid, and as long as I keep posting pre-recorded lectures after I have my baby it counts as days I am working and my sick leave can stretch to keep me fully paid through the end of the semester. Once the semester ends I'm extremely fortunate that my contract pays me over the summer even though I'm not working, so I'll have another few months home with my baby until I return in the fall. But it means that starting in a few weeks I will be back to teaching my labs in-person up until I give birth.

My plan for these weeks at home between semesters was to pre-record all the lectures I will post after my baby is born and prep everything for the sub who will take over teaching my labs. I have been making progress, but it's going much slower than I expected - even working from home I‚Äôm realizing how exhausting everything is at this point in pregnancy, and the thought of going back to commuting and teaching for the last six weeks of my pregnancy is making me so overwhelmed and anxious. I know I can do it and will get everything done, but I just feel so tired even thinking about it. I know it will be worth it because this plan means I get to maximize time at home with my baby while still getting paid, and it has the advantage of moving my tenure clock along (I would lose a whole year if I took the spring semester off entirely). Rationally I know all these things - I know this is the best plan for me, my career, and my family, and am grateful this was even an option. But I‚Äôm so exhausted and so worried about returning to work in a couple weeks. It‚Äôs such a weird scenario to have essentially had two months off (sort of) and then go back to work for the last and probably hardest stretch of the pregnancy.

I‚Äôm trying to remind myself how much I love teaching and that being busy with work has always been good for me and my mental health - I was so relieved to start the fall semester when I was in my first trimester and it really helped distract me from how nauseous and tired I had been feeling. In some ways I think it will be easier once I'm back on campus, because when I'm super tired or feeling sick working from home it's very easy to just give in and stop for the day. I know I can get everything done, I just have to keep pushing through. Has anyone else (especially teachers/professors) been in a similar position?",1738695750.0,1ihpgqp

babybumps,Need encouragement,"Hi all,

Just looking for some encouragement as I know what I need to do, just need the strength to do it.

I am almost 23 weeks. Unfortunately, I am one of those women who has almost continuously had spotting through out her pregnancy. Almost every three weeks or so, I am seeing some blood in my underwear.

There hasn‚Äôt been an identified reason as to why. I have been advised by my doctors at this point to always call in if I see blood and ask for next steps. This past weekend, that call led to an emergency labour and delivery visit, as it was accompanied by pain in my abdomen.

I am fine, and my baby boy is perfect, but this last hospital visit mentally broke me. They sat me down and told me that if I was going into labor, he would be delivered to early to live. 

I am fortunate that did not happen, but since that moment I have been really mentally unwell. Every time I think about it I break down. Today I had a panic attack.

It feels like all the anxiety and stress the physical elements of my pregnancy has caused is catching up with me. I was already very overwhelmed with not being able to do things, the way I look now, and other physical symptoms like nausea, RLP, nosebleeds. The way people treat me also ‚Äî I feel like an incubator. All this, plus a really stressful job that has ramped up is leaving me desolate. I am confused, I am panicking.

I know the next steps ‚Äî I have anxiety disorder and am at high risk for PPD and PPA. I‚Äôm speaking with my therapist tomorrow to begin to get evaluated. Next step after that is to speak with my doctor and let them know I am struggling and the recommendation from my therapist.

I just need encouragement to take those steps. My husband is very supportive and told me if I need to take a leave of absence or quit my job to get mentally ok I can. We‚Äôll figure it out. But I feel guilty I would be leaving a team that needs me. I also feel like I‚Äôm being over dramatic. So many people have harder pregnancies! Why can‚Äôt I survive?

Any positive words to encourage me to take these steps would be appreciated. I know it‚Äôs right thing and my brain is just sabotaging myself, but right now I just feel like I‚Äôm hysterical for no reason.",1738691470.0,1ihnont
babybumps,"FedEx refused to help me with heavy packages, not sure if I should complain or let it go.","I‚Äôm in security and work access control for my building‚Äôs loading dock.

babybumps,AITAH Sister using my middle name for her baby,"I've seen a lot of posts like this and I kind of can guess what the response will be but I guess I'm just having a hard time processing it now that I'm in this position myself so maybe just looking for some support. 

For full transparency, I am not pregnant yet but we have started trying. My sister just started her second trimester and had told me that they had a middle name picked but they were going to keep it a secret until the baby was born. I'm not sure exactly how it came up but I made a comment about ""As long as it isn't *my middle name* since I was planning on using that for my first kid."" She kind of laughed awkwardly and let it go, so I kind of had the feeling that maybe that is what they were planning. Then a couple days ago she let me know that they were planning on using that name and wanted to talk to me first and make sure I was okay with it. 

For background, this is a gender neutral name (different spellings for each gender), and it isn't just my name. It was my dad's middle name, my grandma's middle name, and my great grandfather's (her dad) first name, so it has quite the family history. It's also a name that has become kind of trendy in the modern era, especially as a middle name so it's not like some really old fashioned name that you would be committing too just for the sentimental value.

I didn't really give her a straight answer because I was a little confused and disappointed and just didn't know what to say. I ended up texting her a day or two later after I had time to think. We live in different states and I thought writing what I felt would be easier for me to be clear and concise and I'm not sure when I would see her in person again. I told her that I didn't feel like it was my right to tell her she couldn't use it as it's a family name and it's her legacy too, not just mine, and that I don't own the name. But that for as long as I can remember I have imagined passing that name on to my kid and that I just felt really startled and disoriented and disappointed about the request, and that it wouldn't be my first choice to have our kids have the same middle name as I would definitely still be using it when I have a kid, which she had said she didn't have any problem with. I am not sure why this matters so much to me, but it does and I wanted to make sure she knew that, but I also let her know that I wouldn't hold a grudge forever or be mad and 10 years from now it probably wouldn't matter to me, it's just not what I envisioned. 

She waited two days to text me back because she wanted to talk to her husband about it. Basically though they are still going to use the name and she's ""sorry I feel confused"" but they really like the name and it makes her feel connected to the people who are important to her, her dad and grandma too. It's totally reasonable for her to want to use that name and logically I get it and it's not really fair for me to be mad but it still hurts and I'm not really sure what to say to her. I'm not sure why she asked how I felt about it if they were just going to use it anyway. I'm not willing to start a big family dispute over this, like I kind of feel like she's going to use the name no matter what I say and I would just be digging my own grave by pushing back anymore.

ETA: Now I'm kind of feeling like I might not want to use the name if she's using it. It just feels like too much, idk. I have a lot of time to think about it I guess. ",1738692164.0,1ihnz95

babybumps,So Much For A Late Gender Reveal,"My mother is a hoarder. Since I know this, as well as, the fact that everyone and their mother‚Äôs uncle wants to buy all the clothes in the world for babies to be, I planned our gender reveal late into my pregnancy. That way we got gender neutral clothes (for longevity sake) AND so that my mother SPECIFICALLY could NOT go buy a million things because, again, she wouldn‚Äôt know the gender. 

I told her through my entire pregnancy LITERALLY, that we are well off and only need the things we listed on our registry, that we like to live a simple lifestyle. 

I offered to fly her out to us but she couldn‚Äôt, because lo and behold! My sister (who found out her gender right away) was pregnant with the same gender alongside me and whatever didn‚Äôt go to her baby ended up at my house ON TOP OF stuff she continued to buy (at a great deal ¬¢ of course) just for my baby. 

I have enough stuff from her to fill up 18 full sized garbage bags. All of which she prompted us to open just days after giving birth. It took forever to get through and everything in me not to be angry at her BEFORE baby was here when I saw her carrying in bag after bag from my ring camera at work, and to smile at every piece when we opened every bag, I had to sort through it all which took again forever, it took up space when other guests came to visit, AND I just finished bringing it all out to the garage, whilst taking care of baby alone, while my husband is away for work. I‚Äôm sweaty and annoyed and I fear what happens for when our next child comes around. I‚Äôm upset at how much time it took away from baby and me. I love my mom to bits but Dear Lord Woman! Would you just listen to me? I feel so terrible getting rid of so much. She doesn‚Äôt have much money so why why why does she put me in this position?

babybumps,SI Joint and Risks During Pregnancy,"Hey, everyone. My husband and I have been floating the idea of having a kid within the next 5 years, which is all well and good, but I‚Äôm terrified of what it could mean for my body.

I‚Äôve had chronic SI joint dysfunction since around 2019 and I‚Äôm quickly approaching my early 30s. It affects some of my day-to-day life, a few hours of moving around a bit too much or walking for too long causes intense pain that causes my hips and legs to lock up until I take medication. My doctors believed that it was due to my joints being hypermobile, which makes sense since I‚Äôm able to twist and bend around in ways that I probably shouldn‚Äôt. When I was still working a job that required a lot of movement and physical labor, I would often have to stop standing during peak hours to sit, and was hardly able to climb the stairs to get back into my home when the night was over. Basically, too much physical activity seriously affects my movement.

Almost every resource I look for on this subject concerns SIJ issues caused by pregnancy, but there is very little regarding it as a pre-existing condition going into it. I‚Äôm worried that pregnancy may make my issues even worse, if not impossible to deal with, could lead to more permanent and worse mobility, or even paralysis. It would crush me if I were to have a kid only to not even be able to keep up with them or even really take care of them properly because of my chronic issues. I‚Äôm already not keen on the idea of pregnancy in the first place, but I think I could get over it if it weren‚Äôt for this glaring and possibly dangerous condition, which unlike some peoples‚Äô pregnancy experiences I‚Äôve read about, will never just go away after pregnancy and therapy.

Does anyone out there have any experience with SIJD as a pre-existing condition, or have any resources that might shed some light on what I‚Äôm looking at if a pregnancy is in my future??",1738687398.0,1ihm06q

My biggest fear is of course the baby getting stuck, but also being in labor for hours and hours with an induction for it to then be an emergency c-section in the end. That feels very traumatic to me and I almost wonder if asking for a c-section is a better option.

I could either have a very early shower where I will be 25.5 weeks. Or I can have it on Father's Day. I don't know what to do. On Father's Day I will be 32.5 weeks, so it is a good time in that aspect, but also Father's Day. When is the better time for a shower, a touch to early or for a few hours on a nationwide celebratory day? I am doing brunch style so my thought is that maybe if I open it up to children, dads can take some time to golf or whatever they want in the morning/early afternoon and then families will have the remaining afternoon together? I also do not mind the idea of an early shower, at 25.5 weeks, it will give me time to get everything together and pick up things I still need etc. But will other people think its odd? I suppose either way there will most likely be some judgement, but which one is the better option?

I do understand that I have the option to check other venues, but I really have my heart set here. Its been a long road (late miscarriage, 3 years of infertility, 7 cycles of medication, 4 IUIs, 4 IVF cycles) and took me until last week to even feel like this could actually be real.

It took a really long time to conceive again, we had even booked a first appointment towards IVF for last month, but I am now finally almost at the end of the first trimester. 

We just got a low risk NIPT result and after everything I‚Äôve been through I should feel so incredibly grateful, but recently I have started feeling deeply sad about everything. It was triggered by finding out on the test that the gender is not what I wanted but an avalanche of emotion is just making me feel like the whole thing is wrong. 

It will be born at completely the wrong time of the year to do the trip I had hoped for, I will already have had to return to work. The due timing also means I will miss my best friend‚Äôs wedding altogether, instead of taking my baby to show off üò© It‚Äôs never going to be the experience that I had dreamed of. 

Due to some ongoing stuff at work there‚Äôs a reasonable chance I will get made redundant this year and if that happens before I go on maternity leave and they choose not to pay it out, it will be a total financial disaster.

my partner and i are trying to get pregnant, and i‚Äôm wondering if there are any good ways to predict ovulation if your periods are irregular. we‚Äôve tried using a period tracking/conception helper app (it‚Äôs only ever accurately predicted my period once so i don‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs ovulation prediction dates are accurate either), basal temperature tracking (still not sure how that‚Äôs supposed to work as my temp seems to go up and down with no clear pattern, altho we haven‚Äôt tracked for very long yet), and ovulation kits (the instructions say to start using it 17 days before my period, which isn‚Äôt much help if i don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôs going to be). 

spoke to a doctor recently and she just suggested ‚Äúincreasing the frequency of sex‚Äù instead of trying to predict ovulation ‚Äî so maybe that‚Äôs the best course of action?

anyone have any tips or anecdotes about what you did if you were in a similar situation yourself?
thanks so much in advance! ",1738655206.0,1ihclhn

I'm having the usual first trimester symptoms and things mostly seem fine, but I keep waking up startled and full of adrenaline like I need to run for my life. This is happening about half an hour after I fall asleep, whether I'm napping or trying to go to sleep for the night. 

Is this normal? Is there anything I can do about it to get better rest? I know stress isn't good for the fetus. But overall it's just very disorienting and distressing, and it's disrupting my sleep. 

It may not even be pregnancy related. It may be that I quit nicotine pouches cold turkey when I found out and it has something to do with the withdrawal.  I'll ask my doctor about it once I can get an appointment, but I thought it wouldn't hurt to post about.",1738642703.0,1ih9cwe

babybumps,Feeling discouraged over anatomy scan follow up. Needing support.,"I (STM) had my anatomy scan at 22 weeks. I was kind of annoyed that it was scheduled two weeks later than normal, but my clinic assured me that a bigger fetus meant better images (spoiler: this hasn't been the case at all). 

Following my scan, the report said that fetal anatomy looked good, but that the aorta appeared enlarged in some (not all) heart views and that these specific views should be retaken because it may just be the angle of the images causing the aorta to appear enlarged. My clinic made me a follow up appointment for 4 weeks later (sigh) assuring me that it would be easier to retake the images once the baby was larger and in a different position. 

Well today was my follow up appointment. As soon as the doppler touched my stomach the sonograher started fussing over how the baby was, again, in a bad position for heart views and how she would just have to take the images even though they were likely to be suboptimal...again. She had me go to the bathroom, do squats, drink water - nothing seemed to help. She told me I am likely to be referred for a fetal echo (heart specific ultrasound) but not to stress, because this is all just to be super careful since she hasn't been able to capture good images herself. 

I appreciated her honestly but this isn't what I was expecting. All this time, the clinic has told me they'd be able to get good images. And last time, the (same) sonographer seemed upbeat and positive during the ultrasound even though the images she was capturing were apparently suboptimal. So for her to show frustration today was really discouraging (even though I understand her frustration). It made me feel stupid for trying to stay positive for a whole month while waiting for this follow up appointment. 

What on earth was the point of waiting 4 weeks? I wish they would've referred me for a fetal echo right away since they haven't been able to clarify the situation at all. Is something wrong with my baby?! I'm 26 weeks pregnant. When I google personal stories about fetal heart defects I see people receiving diagnoses around 18-20 weeks, not 26-28 ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

I just feel so discouraged. My husband is wonderfully supportive but he's out of town right now. I haven't really told family about what's going on because I don't want to deal with questions before I know if there's actually an issue.

babybumps,TTC,"Trigger warning ‚ö†Ô∏è loss.



So back when I graduated with my Bachelor‚Äôs degree hubby and I decided to start trying shortly after. Got pregnant and found out on my first day of my Master‚Äôs program.  I lost the pregnancy and didn't get to find out until 10 weeks that I had a blighted ovum.  Tried to do it the natural way and let my body deal with it. (If I had a time machine I'd go for the D&C.) I ended up hemorrhaging and at the ER. Very very traumatic! This was a week before finals ... I ended up passing everything! Fast forward 2 months end up with a chemical pregnancy. Last semester in my 1 year degree I get pregnant again but ectopic. 

Since the 3 losses I've had numerous labs, and ultrasounds.  Found out I'm insulin resistance and also have metabolic syndrome with inflammation issues.  I've worked on my mental health and physical health. I've lost 90 but gained 15 back since starting weight lifting.  I'm way healthier. 

We are now trying 2 years later again. This cycle didn't work...or at least I'm 99% sure as I have pretty regular cycles and tomorrow is the day I'm supposed to start and there is no lines on any of the strips I've tested for pregnancy.

I know I just started again but I'm disappointed. Hubby is super supportive and I have a great support system. Just needing to vent because it's been weighing on me and I'm trying to write it down to let it go. ",1738636700.0,1ih7gqx

babybumps,Did anyone get a UTI from giving birth?,"I have a history of chronic/recurrent UTIs. My last UTI episode lasted nine continuous months, during which time I had nonstop symptoms and nothing could give me any relief. I went to so many urologists, urogyns, infectious disease experts... Took every test, was prescribed every antibiotic, antispasmodic, and pain reliever under the sun. Nothing worked. I'm happy to share that I did eventually recover and get my life back after a nearly a year of twice daily Hiprex and serious lifestyle changes, but the whole incident left me severely traumatized. 

I'm terrified of what will happen if I get another UTI, and I'm particularly scared that I will get one from giving birth. It's my main reason for refusing an epidural, because I am confident based on my history that a catheter will cause an infection. I'm wondering if anyone can share their experiences or share any tips for avoiding this during labor/hospital birth. Thank you!

babybumps,"Induction Saturday, feeling down d/t my parents being uninvolved (vent)","\*\*LONG POST WARNING\*\* 

I've been lurking around here and always in awe of the wonderful community here. I guess I'm just looking to vent/see if AITA? I'm 30yo FTM, happily married for 2.5 years, in a demanding career. Oldest daughter of immigrant parents who live 3 hours from me now. Pregnancy was unplanned but we're at a place where we decided it'd be good to continue. I have a very supportive husband and my inlaws live near us. 

My parents have always been supportive of my choices, first in family to go to college/grad school/now a have good career, they've always been proud. My parents have tumultuous relationship (anxiety disorder/dad is a heavy alcohol user/intermittent explosive disorder/DV..etc.). 

When I was about 10 weeks pregnant, we visited my parents at their home, my dad got in one of his drunken monologue and started saying hurtful stuff about my mom and I (emotional abuse, nothing new). Usually I don't bother responding, and my mom ignores it too. I know he has his own anxiety/depression struggles..and I tried to help but he doesn't want to help himself. At one point, I just couldn't listen to him and started speaking up and correcting him, saying he's being hurtful and he should watch what comes out of his mouth. That got him going and he just yelled and yelled and at one point told my husband and I to leave his house. We were packing up to go, but then he came to his senses a little and had my mom talk us into staying. We were gonna leave the next day anyways. This is not a new occurrence in our family - again my dad says crap when drunk, I respond, we argue, then brush past it eventually. 

But this time, somehow it was different. My husband (white) witnessed it - he's very rational and explained that I wasn't in the wrong because I was just trying to stand up for myself. We're a south asian/patriarchal culture. I decided that I wasn't going to brush this off because this can't be something we normalize for our child. But my dad is very hard headed, and he will not reach out and apologize either - he needs me to. It's a BIG misunderstanding. My mom initially acted as a buffer, but now she's taking his side and accepting his irrational demands/behavior. Telling me that I have to be the bigger person and apologize/hash out all the past trauma, bc my dad is ready to but needs me to reach out. My mom and I used to talk daily, now 3-4 weeks go by without her reaching out to me. They're waiting for me to initiate something/apologize/meet up/I honestly don't know. My husband tried to tell my dad, like months ago, (without my knowledge) about how he saw the situation, and he should try and patch this up, but my dad just blamed me. 

They didn't attend my baby shower that my MIL threw us, initially saying they'll come and backing out the last minute. It really hurt. Everyone around me knows how supportive my parents are usually, and asks about them, and I make up some stupid excuse. This is their first grandchild, uncharted territory, and I honestly don't know what I was expecting. My mom's excuse is that she can't do anything without my dad/drive to come see me. It's straining my sister and I's relationship but I'm trying keep that going. \[Of note- I have a younger sister (14), and when my mom was pregnant with her and ended up having a c-section, I was very involved with her pregnancy.\] 

Now I'm almost 37w pregnant, about to have ecv/c-section coming Saturday. I was hospitalized past weekend due to severe BPs, and diagnosed with gHTN. I thought I should let my mom know so I made her aware, she called to check a couple times but that was it. I don't think they're planning to be here. I never saw doing this season of life without my mom. It's making me tearful as I'm typing this.. I honestly just tried to ignore it but now...it's just really unexpected and painful... like I think this has went too far and I don't know if I should just pretend like my parents don't exist or make a call to my dad, which I really don't want to do. This is  soout of character for them.. never have I ever saw this coming. My dad ices out his siblings and other around him, but never me. 

I guess.. AITA? 

I'll try my best to connect with a therapist this week so I have appropriate people to talk with post partum, but thought I'd share here as well.. ",1738631793.0,1ih5sem

babybumps,Babyletto yuzu owners...talk to me,"Hi all!

My mother has very kindly offered to buy us a crib. We have a tiny nursery, and while it'll fit a full sized crib, I've found myself obsessed with the babyletto yuzu in walnut as we can use it in bassinet form and midi form, saving substantial space. I also like that I can wheel it around our house.

My concerns are that, despite high reviews, some people say it scratches easily and it can be hard to find bedding. However, some of the reviews are quite old and I know manufacturing and quality can change over time, as can bedding availability.

So, does anyone here absolutely love or hate their yuzu? Anything I should keep in mind I might not be considering?",1738628198.0,1ih4i3l
babybumps,"Positive, precipitous home birth at 36w0d","I wanted to share my recent home birth story, in hopes of inspiring other moms who plan to have a home birth!

I had just gotten home from a long day at work (I even stayed at work 30 min late to get stuff done). I was quite exhausted, being 36 weeks pregnant, and on my feet most of the day. 
Two days prior, I had lost my mucus plug, which was accompanied with mild contractions that stopped after an hour or so, with no further symptoms of an impending labor.

I sat down to snack on some cheese, and felt a pop followed by a stream of clear water, pouring out from my vagina uncontrollably. I just started laughing, which caused even more water to come out. Mild cramps immediately began. Despite this, it still didn‚Äôt dawn on me that I was in labor. Within a few minutes, my husband came home from work, and I tearfully informed him my water broke, which he was in as much disbelief as I was. I called my midwife, who confirmed baby will be here soon, as she said I could either go to the hospital since I was 36 weeks, or if I was willing, we would deliver baby at home, but there‚Äôs a higher chance of a transfer. I decided to stay home, as the thought of going to a hospital made me more nervous than staying home. For an hour, my contractions progressively and quickly became intense. Within 45 min of my initial call, we called my midwife again but this time I was unable to speak through contractions and it was very intense. My midwife was on the way, but warned she was an hour away or so. 
I pooped three times, felt nauseous, and at some point took all my clothes off due to hot flashes (despite swearing I would never birth naked). I desperately wanted to take a bath with warm water, but my midwife warned against bathing since my waters had broken. I opted to lay on the floor in the shower with hot water running over me. During this stretch, laying in the shower, I just felt the immense pressure of needing to poop. In my head, I knew this was an indication of needing to push, but I thought there is no way I‚Äôm *there* yet. But with every contraction, my body was pushing against my will into my butt, and I was certain I was going to have an anal prolapse/poop all at once, but nothing came out. 
After roughly 30 minutes of this, a back up midwife arrived who was a pure angel and escorted me to bed and checked mine and baby‚Äôs vitals. Everything was fine. I had a couple contractions on my hands and knees, with my husband doing counter pressure, but somehow this made everything feel worse.
I laid on my back on the bed, where I just prayed through each contraction, with that pressure in my butt never fully ceasing. 
I reached down to touch myself, and felt my baby‚Äôs head. I almost didn‚Äôt know what I was feeling, again in disbelief, and I didn‚Äôt know if I should allow myself to push or what. The back up midwife seemed to want me to wait for my actual midwife to arrive, so she didn‚Äôt guide me one way or the other (which I now regret).
At roughly 8:30pm (2 hrs, and 15 min after my water broke), my midwife arrived and supported me in pushing my baby out. 
I intentionally pushed for about 10 minutes, being careful to go slow, easing into it to avoid tearing. I was amazed at how I was not screaming/crying in pain, as I had envisioned. It was calm, controlled, and painful yes, but not torturous. I pushed out baby‚Äôs head, which was certainly the most intense part of it all. I waited about 1 minute for the next contraction, before pushing the rest of her out, into my husband‚Äôs arms. It was miraculous how any discomfort I had immediately dissipated, and I became a mother in that moment. It was the best feeling in the world, and always will be.
My baby was perfect - An Apgar of 9, despite being a month early. She was 5lbs, 12 oz, and had the most perfect fuzzy head. My placenta followed suit, and bleeding was quite minimal which was a relief! 

After a whirlwind 2.5 hours of labor, my baby was here. It was amazing to me how I could do a full day at work, come home and give birth in under 3 hours. My husband and I stayed up until 3am, laughing and basking in joy and love, trying to piece it all together. 

I had heard tales of precipitous labors, but never would have thought that would be my story. The female body is amazing. Birth is amazing, life changing. And I hope everyone who aspires to have a home birth, is able to achieve a safe and beautiful delivery.",1738626099.0,1ih3qeo

I have to do the evening cleaning sometimes, which involves taking out the sometimes heavy trash (ü§¢), cleaning the bathrooms, and vacuuming the rugs. This shift usually lasts about 3 hours, but afterwards I am so tired.

When I get tired I get emotional and then I cry for a good 30 minutes or get angry and curse whoever misplaced something that I needed to clean or whoever decided to put like 1,000 plastic bags in the recycling box to where I can't even tie the bag. 

I'm debating on whether or not changing my availability. I have a *long* shift coming up on Friday, 11-8, and I already know that I can't handle that. I'm trying to get it swapped out but I'm having no luck so far. 

Also, THE HUNGER. I get hungry like every 3-4 hours instead of the usual 5-6. When I work long stretches, we are often too busy for me to get a snack and we can't eat food in front of customers. I also have an appetite problem where it's pretty much non-existent because I'm scared of eating something that'll make me vomit.

babybumps,When to start maternity leave?,"I am based in the U.S. and the company I work for has a VERY generous maternity leave policy for the U.S. In total, I get 19 weeks of maternity plus I get 4 weeks of vacation a year and can accrue 10 sick days a year. Very very generous. 

I am due in June and I was originally planning on taking a week of vacation before my due date and then go on maternity leave after my due date. However I‚Äôm allowed to start my maternity leave 2 weeks before my due date and I‚Äôd still have 2 weeks of vacation to use (not including any accrued sick time). I could essentially take off the entire month of May so I‚Äôd stop working at 36 weeks and then I‚Äôd go back in October once my baby starts daycare. 

A couple of factors I‚Äôm considering: 

- our daycare doesn‚Äôt give us any vacation weeks the first year so regardless of if she‚Äôs there or not we have to pay for the full week. 
- if I stick with my original plan, I have about two weeks in between when she goes to daycare and when I go back to work so she‚Äôll be at daycare all day and I‚Äôll just be at home. 
- if I pivot to my new plan, I can stop working a bit ahead of time, but I‚Äôd have to go back to work at the same time she‚Äôs going to daycare.

I have PCOS and since we have been together for 6 years already, and we're not getting any younger, I decided to take the a leap of faith and ditch the BC. 

Last Thursday my husband, woke up and told me I need to take a pregnancy test. When I asked him why, he said he dreamt that I took 3 tests and they all came up positive.

You can be brutally honest- I want to know what I‚Äôm in for, & if baby could have any potential medical complications due to the situation.

babybumps,Sex is hurting 10 months post-partum,"Need reassurance!

I'm 10 months postpartum. Difficult delivery with complications: vacuum and small 3rd degree tear. I had a stitch that broke at about 6 weeks postpartum. I saw the gynecologist 1 time who gave me the ok. I did several sessions of perineal reeducation. The good news is that I've never had any incontinence.

The other evening, I tried to have penetrative sex. The first time... I was terrified. My husband was able to insert all the way, but it felt like the bottom of my vulva wanted to tear. We stopped.

Since then, I've been terrified of doing it again. I wonder if I've been badly stitched up? When I look down, it's as if there's a kind of skin covering 1/6 of the vagina. Is this normal? I've got an appointment with my gynecologist in 2 weeks... please tell me it's getting better, I'm afraid I won't be able to have sex anymore. Thank you for your help.

I am estimated to be about five weeks pregnant. I am also 6 months postpartum and never got my period which is why I was brought in to see  how far along I am.

It started last Friday and was just a smear of bright red blood mixed in with clear discharge. The next two following days I had some light spotting that was brownish pink and tacky. The bleeding seems to have stopped but I am so worried this is a failed pregnancy.

To me this seems like an insane drop, but the midwife who reviewed my results from today didn't say anything about it. Whoever called me on the phone to go over the results said that the midwife would have noted if it were cause for concern.

Like, her head isn't keeping up with how fast her body is growing. At this rate she will be microcephalic by birth. Why would that *not* be a cause for concern?

So, I'm currently 25 weeks pregnant and have been dealing with the most awful constipation and bloating for about three months. At one point it got so bad that I had to go to the ER to get an enema because I was so backed up that I couldn't eat, and my stomach was so hard and distended that I could barely move (all this on a vacation no less). I've since been taking a dose of miralax every day, along with 1,000 mg magnesium citrate gummies every day. Its helped some, my stool is soft now but my intestines still just don't want to push it out. What does come out is soft, but it's such a tiny few bits each day that comes out...so not much relief. So every 1-2 weeks I still have to use a saline enema to flush everything out, and a LOT comes out when I do that. Big TMI incoming: everything that does come out is like a paste, so I know my stool is very soft, it just still doesn't come out for some reason? Is this just something I have to suffer with until the pregnancy ends or is there something else I can do. I tried upping the miralax dosage to two capfuls a day instead of one, but that causes so much intestinal water retention that it's very painful and uncomfortable, and causes my stomach to distend and stretch to it's maximum capacity. I've already talked with my OB and they can't recommend anything other than miralax or colace unfortunately, they did say to watch the fiber intake because it can possibly make me even more backed up.",1738604393.0,1iguuaq

babybumps,Reassurance about induction,"I‚Äôm 40+3 today and a FTM. I‚Äôm planning for a vaginal birth epidural and I‚Äôve had a very smooth pregnancy without any complications. 

My OB has me down for an induction tonight based solely on due date and I‚Äôm feeling uneasy about it a little bit due to the fact that I feel like if I just get baby a few more days, maybe she‚Äôd come on her own. However, the scheduling for inductions is apparently very limited and all we were able to get is tonight. If I don‚Äôt show up tonight, I‚Äôm not sure if or when another induction opportunity would arise if it ended up being something I wanted. 

My concern with induction is that if just feels like an artificial push to get baby out when she‚Äôs not ready and if she‚Äôs completely healthy, I feel like letting it happen on its own is better. With the due date being an estimate and first time pregnancies usually going a bit overdue, I feel she would arrive on her own safety with a bit more time. Although, avoiding a NST and other appointments that could be required for going more overdue would be ideal as well. 

Overall, im not worried about induction having a negative effect on the baby since that is not shown to be the case with inductions at this stage, but I don‚Äôt want the experience to be significantly more painful or lead to complications just cause I was induced. But since I‚Äôm getting an epidural anyways I‚Äôm wondering if I my concerns are valid anyways. 

I also don‚Äôt want to skip induction and put my baby at risk if she decides not to come for a while still. Any thoughts on the situation or helpful reassurance on induction would be great. ",1738598659.0,1igshd0

babybumps,I don't know how to prepare,"Hi.

I am 4 months pregnant and feeling very overwhelmed.  
I do not live in my home country and have no family around me. Only my fiance who is..lets just leave it at that.. 

So unfortunately, I am feeling very alone.   
I don't know where to start preparing. 

I see lots of videos online of women preparing by buying all the baby stuff, drinking special tea, going to all sorts of classes, eating special food... I just am not doing anything except taking folic acid.   
Does anyone have any sort of checklist or something to share? 

Thank you.",1738597025.0,1igrtvi
babybumps,First OBGYN Appointment Seems Too Far Out - 13 Weeks for In-Person,"I‚Äôm 34 and just found out a week ago that I‚Äôm pendant for the first time, (the guesstimate is that I‚Äôm currently at 4 weeks and 6 days along today). I have only taken home pregnancy tests.

When I called the recommended OBGYN office last week, the scheduler said their policy is to wait until week 12 for a mandatory phone call to do medical history on the mother and father, then the first in-person appointment isn‚Äôt until week 13. 

Everything I‚Äôve read makes it sound like being seen 8-10 weeks is normal, (sometimes up to 12). I expressed concerns to the scheduler about waiting so long past the norm‚Äîespecially with my age, having thyroid issues, being almost pre-diabetic/insulin resistant when I got pregnant‚Äî I also have ADHD so I was taking meds that I was sure could harm the baby. The scheduler scheduled an appointment for this week‚Äî but said that it would be strictly non-OB related‚Äî basically just so I can ask questions. I think I might cancel it since my PCP already responded and told me which medications to take, but I‚Äôm also really concerned about not being physically seen or having any tests run until week 13. 

Should I be concerned? Should I keep fighting to get seen OB-wise around week 8 instead? 

It kind of comes off to me like the office doesn‚Äôt want to bother with people who miscarry, so that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt see before 13 weeks‚Äî but I can‚Äôt help but wonder if seeing someone sooner would be better for my baby and help reduce the risk of miscarriage. (They also bounce patients between providers and your delivery person sounds like it‚Äôs whoever is on call that week‚Äî that doesn‚Äôt sound normal to me, but I have never been in this position before so I don‚Äôt really know what is normal.)

babybumps,Getting in my head about my provider - Reassurance?,"Recently found I‚Äôm pregnant after a little under a year of trying! (YAYY!) Had my confirmation appointment at my typical gyn and I‚Äôm not feeling good. 

First I‚Äôm really tied up about my projected weight gain being 18 pounds???? I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and 135 pounds and exercise regularly. My own research shows this is the weight gain for an overweight/obese pregnant person? Is it normal for them to give such a low number? I feel like I‚Äôm being set up for failure. My mom gained 80 pounds her first pregnancy and my mother in law gained 50. My husband is 6‚Äô5 and also physically fit. I don‚Äôt think 18 pounds is remotely realistic. 

Additionally I had explained that I have irregular and long cycle periods and they didn‚Äôt listen to anything I said??? They asked for the first date of my last period and then TYPED IT INTO GOOGLE ‚ÄúIf first day of period **** when due date‚Äù and told me that date and put it in my chart. 

The third weird thing was that they just did another pee test for my confirmation appointment and they also said it was somewhat faint? Okay????? Does that matter  I thought a line at all meant positive???? I literally was probably like barely 4 weeks pregnant at the time. 

Is this normal? Am I overreacting? Am I going to feel like this the whole time? This is the best rated ob/gyn in my area.

babybumps,Brainfog/dizzy non stop,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm 26 weeks pregnant and have been experiencing dizziness. Well... it's not per se dizziness as the world is not spinning but more a lack of registering the world and feeling very weak in the knees or something. Feeling very weak in general by this lack of focus of my surroundings. It happens especially when I go shopping in larger stores like grocery stores or home improvement stores, when in groupsettings with friends or when it is hot outside. It gets so bad that I feel like I‚Äôm about to faint. I work full-time during the week, so I usually run errands on the weekends, and that‚Äôs when it hits me the hardest.

I know dizziness can be normal during pregnancy, but this feels extreme. Some background:

* I‚Äôve been experiencing this 'dizziness' for at least three weeks now. Doctor/OB GYN says all is fine.
* I was tested for anemia and gestational diabetes a few weeks ago, and everything came back normal.
* I eat regularly and with focus on iron (lot of kale), so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs from skipping meals or iron deficiency
* I try to stay hydrated, but maybe I need more?
* I have experienced this before the pregnancy as well. Doctors then qualified it as anxiety symptoms, but never truly believed it was all mental. But maybe it can be related to this as well?

Has anyone else experienced this kind of dizziness in big stores specifically? Is this just a normal pregnancy thing, or could it be something more concerning? Any tips on how to handle it?",1738585769.0,1ignyf3
babybumps,Frustrated with MIL,"My MIL is a very sweet woman. Honestly, I've never had any issues with her before getting pregnant. A few quirks here and there, but I genuinely enjoy her company. Lately, it feels like she's been invading my privacy. I'm about 17 weeks pregnant and my husband and I announced our pregnancy to her during the holidays a few weeks before I finished my first trimester. We only told immediate family at that point since we wanted to finish the first trimester. I'm also considered to be at a higher risk due to my age. She asked if she could tell other family members and I asked her to hold off since I did not feel comfortable. I did not even tell my extended family at that point. I didn't really care as much if she told her friends that don't know my husband and I really, and we were only asking her to wait less than 2 weeks until I gave the green light after my next dr. appointment. I later found out at a family function that she told her other family anyway, despite me asking her to wait, which was pretty annoying. Luckily, my appointment went well and everything was fine, but I feel like I can't trust her. 

The second frustration happened more recently. She asked to call me and my husband and he put her on speaker phone. She shared that she has a friend from her church that we don't know, and confirmed her friend's daughter is pregnant with her first and the baby is due a few months before my due date. I guess we're around the same age and they had to do IVF to conceive. She asked if she could share my phone number so I could talk to this random person about our pregnancies and this woman can ""tell me what to buy and offer advice."" I don't mean to sound ungrateful because I know my MIL cares, but I feel like my pregnancy is not really anyone's business unless I make it my business to share. I don't want to speak with a stranger about my pregnancy, and my MIL suggested we meet in person too. It's just very weird to me and I've become a more private person by nature as I've gotten older. I didn't even announce my pregnancy on social media and I still have friends I haven't told yet. I still haven't told my aunts and uncles. I value my privacy and I honestly don't want her advice on things to buy. I already have a support system with my sister who has kids and other mom friends of mine. I don't mean to sound rude but it feels so odd to have someone try to impose something like this on me. It would be different if I told my MIL I was overwhelmed and needed guidance. I haven't really shared anything with her except my first ultrasound photo. My husband is also clueless so he agreed to it before I even had a chance to say anything. And then my MIL asked if I was ok with it and I felt obligated to say yes so that I didn't sound rude. It's just so awkward and weird. She really means well, but it really feels like an invasion of my privacy. I know she's just really excited for us since our baby will be her first grandchild and her only daughter doesn't want to have kids, but it's just a lot. I'm not sure how to navigate things from here. I'm not even halfway through my pregnancy and she's already getting on my nerves. I don't want to hurt her feelings either, but I feel like clearer boundaries need to be defined. Or am I going crazy and being unreasonable? It's just stressing me out a lot.  ",1738585762.0,1ignyci

S$1 = US$0.73

These bills do not include the cost of my prenatal visits. I had:

	‚Ä¢	One appointment per month in the earlier stages of pregnancy.

	‚Ä¢	Ultrasounds at every other visit (e.g., if I had an ultrasound in one visit, the next visit would not have one).

	‚Ä¢	As my due date got closer, weekly visits with ultrasounds at every appointment.

babybumps,I‚Äôm having a hard time coming to terms with an unplanned c section. I‚Äôd appreciate all the adviceüôèüèª,"I had a healthy pregnancy. I was a health nut even before I got pregnant. I exercised, ate healthy, put in all the effort to be healthy. At my 38wk appointment, my ob said that she‚Äôs happy with where I am, that I was on track and that she expected me to have a vaginal delivery. Fast forward two weeks, I was overdue by a couple days and it was getting hard to feel the baby‚Äôs movements. My doctor suggested an elective induction as it would be risky not being able to track baby‚Äôs movements, the baby was already at an estimated weight of 3.5kg and there are no pros to waiting it out. I was induced same day, it took about 24 hours to get to 10 cm. I had to get morphine during the dilation procedure and an epidural after they gave me pitocin as the pain was unbearable after I tried to manage pain with breathing and birthball exercises. However the baby‚Äôs heartbeat dropped when I was 10 cm and head was still at +2. I was rushed to the OR, the plan was to try using a vacuum to get the baby out and if it fails they‚Äôd do an emergency c section. Once I was in the OR(7mins since the heart rate dropped), they reassessed and recommended a c section would be a safer choice. If the vacuum fails, that‚Äôs another 4 mins wasted. They did a c section and the baby had to be resuscitated, she had started to turn blue. I‚Äôm recovering and the baby is healthy. However I‚Äôm having a hard time coming to terms with it 4 days after giving birth. Recurring thoughts such as ‚Äúshould I have waited it out instead of choosing elective induction? Did I do choose epidural too early?‚Äù Also I had planned for delayed cord clamping and skin to skin after birth which didn‚Äôt happen. All these are making me sleepless. I‚Äôd appreciate any suggestions and advice to cope with these feelings.

It's as if she just injected heroin. It's easy enough to make her sleep after that.

When she drinks milk from boobies, she doesn't seem as ""stoned"" and it's much much harder to get her to sleep. She's just very fussy and never looks or even feels very full.

Since she's mostly breastfed, it means she's mostly awake and fussy and never seems full.

What's the problem? Is the baby supposed to get ""stoned"" from breastfeeding? Or is it only formula that does this?

Could it be a problem with mother's milk supply or ""flow rate""? Too slow, or not enough?

Dr. thinks it's just a harmless growth that can be triggered by hormonal changes (im 38 weeks) but did the biopsy just to be safe.

babybumps,Nausea coming back second trimester,At around 13/14 weeks my nausea went away almost entirely besides it coming back every once in a while for a day at most. I am currently 17 weeks now and on friday night the nausea came back along with throwing up at first I thought it was maybe something I ate as my boyfriend had me try what he had gotten for dinner that night and it wasn‚Äôt good so I thought maybe the baby just didn‚Äôt like it. However it is now sunday and the nausea hasn‚Äôt gone away I have not thrown up since ü§û but I do keep gagging throughout the day. I don‚Äôt have a fever or any other symptoms of being sick either.

babybumps,Friend wanted to throw my baby shower so bad,"I have a close group of friends and one of the friends is also pregnant, due the same week as me. Another mutual friend in the group said from the start, like the very first thing she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm throwing you a joint baby shower!‚Äù. I‚Äôm a FTM, but the baby shower wasn‚Äôt really something I was excited about because I feel like it‚Äôs asking people to buy us things, which we don‚Äôt really need help with. However, I went along with this because she was really excited and I thought it might be fun to do with my other pregnant friend. She told us we could make the guest list whoever we wanted and we‚Äôve joked together about not inviting distant uncles, etc. Fast forward to now (I‚Äôm 22 weeks and the baby shower was going to be early April) and she finally looked at our guest list and said we had to cut all males from it (aside from parents and hubbies) because she couldn‚Äôt host that many people at her house. I was really upset about this because having my husband‚Äôs support system there as well as male relatives was really important to me. My husband didn‚Äôt really care, but I felt like we were excluding important people and that babies aren‚Äôt a single, female only celebration. I told her all this and she got quite upset. I told her it was fine and we could split the baby showers and I would handle my own, to which she said it would be fine as she could still do it as long as I only invite local women. I drew the line here, expressed my gratitude for her help, but said I would rather do my own shower and have my family help, that way everyone who I want to be there will be there and she doesn‚Äôt need to worry about space. I said the party in April can be for our other pregnant friend (who was okay with only females) and I will have mine later. She ghosted me for the night and then came back this morning and was very short, just saying that‚Äôs fine and she‚Äôll throw the party for our other friend and it will be fun. Oh and will I please make the cake for her (I‚Äôm a baker). 

I was really upset about this and I feel like I‚Äôm having to apologize for just setting a boundary and helping to compromise (me splitting my own shower off) since we didn‚Äôt have room for everyone I would have wanted to have there. I sent her an apology for any stress this caused and she sent me a one word reply. Should I feel guilty about this? Should I have just let her throw me the party even if it would have excluded important people to me? I was never mean in my wording and always expressed gratitude, but I‚Äôm really upset that she still seems to be upset but won‚Äôt talk about it. This whole thing is really stressing me out when all I wanted was for it to be casual and easy. ",1738524884.0,1ig5hn2

babybumps,We‚Äôre now a family of 3!,"We made it through! Despite how it all felt in the third trimester, I was not actually pregnant forever. I delivered my little son on January 30th at 5:41pm, two days before his due date. I wanted to tell you guys how it went while it‚Äôs still fresh in my mind and to provide a not-so-scary birth story. 

I started having regular contractions every ~15mins apart in the afternoon of the 29th, so I knew it was getting to be time. In my opinion, everyone who told me that contractions feel like bad period cramps deserves a hug because I‚Äôve never had period cramps that felt like that. To me, it felt like being punched in the pubic mound area. The contractions continued throughout the night getting stronger and closer together. We decided to go to the hospital at 5:00am because we live like 30mins from the hospital and wanted to avoid a situation where it was go time during rush hour traffic. 

We got to the hospital. They checked both of us; the baby was stable and I was unfortunately only 2cm dilated but 80% effaced. They let us walk around the L&D floor for a couple hours before checking us again. When they did I was 3cm dilated and 90% effaced, so they let us choose to stay or go home. We chose to stay because we‚Äôd hate to go home then immediately turn around and come back. 

After we got in a room, I was lucky and my OB was the OB on call that day. He checked me out himself and manually broke my waters to move things along. I chose to get an epidural after that because I hadn‚Äôt slept last night with the contractions and I wanted to make sure I‚Äôd have energy to push. The epidural didn‚Äôt do what I‚Äôd hoped though, it really only numbed my right leg. I had a rockstar nurse who advocated me to get another a couple hours later after it was clear it wasn‚Äôt working and laying in different positions wasn‚Äôt fixing it. The anesthesiologist kept asking if I was feeling pain or pressure, and in the moment I couldn‚Äôt articulate the difference. I got a second epidural placed when I was 6cm dilated. The second worked fantastic though and I got my nap. 

The nurse came and checked me a few hours later and I was 10cm dilated. She contacted the doctor and told them to get ready to come over (my OB had a family situation come up so it was someone new) and had me get ready to push. The nurse said she‚Äôd help me push until he was crowning, then the doctor would take over the delivery. I pushed like 3 times, and the nurse called the doctor back to tell them to hurry up because I was moving quickly.

The second epidural was fantastic! I felt the pressure of him moving down, but I couldn‚Äôt feel the pain of birth and was actually laughing with the nurse. Unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt feel my contractions so she had to coach me, but it was alright. She told me I had to stop laughing actually because I was pushing the baby out with it and the doctor wasn‚Äôt there yet. 

The doctor was a couple minutes late but she got there and helped me deliver my son in a couple pushes. All told, I was only pushing for 40mins. When the held up my son, it was surreal. I knew he was inside me, but I couldn‚Äôt imagine how the baby I saw was in me minutes ago. He was 6lbs 15oz and 20 3/4in long. I got two little tears, they said second degree, but not too bad. My vagina feels like it got in a fight, but you should see the other guy. He‚Äôs the cutest little baby ever! ",1738521745.0,1ig47w0

babybumps,don't get the Hatch rest - subscription hell,"Virtually every desired feature is locked behind a subscription. They are selling you this device just to sell you their **subscription** service.

My biggest gripe is that you **can‚Äôt use this as a Wi-Fi speaker**, even though it is 100% capable of doing so. Hatch deliberately crippled that function to force you into using their **subscription-based** library of sounds and stories. Why does Hatch not allow us to stream our own audio? Most of us already have a music subscription service loaded with audio stories we can use. Hatch knows this and would rather us pay them more to use their subscription library instead. That is anti-consumerist and greedy.

Even the **light-changing effects** are locked behind a **subscription**! I can understand charging for customized sounds and stories, but lighting effects?! Really?

At the bare minimum free level, this device is on par with dozens of other baby sound machines that cost **a quarter of the price**. If you choose not to subscribe, you only get 16 sounds and 3 songs‚Äîsomething other devices offer as a baseline, all while still allowing you to stream your own audio.

I do not recommend this device at all. We got this as a baby shower gift. We unboxed it way after the return date, completely disappointed that our relative wasted money on this.

Obviously I need two seats, I want tandem style to fit in narrow sidewalks and small stores, etc. I'm also hoping to have bassinet attachment options and be able to install infant car seats on it as well. 

The only systems I've seen that have all of these options are the bugaboo donkey 5 and the UPPAbaby vista 3 but the UPPAbaby has a new returns policy and is 1900 for everything. And the bugaboo is like 2400!?

Now I just saw Gladly released a new convertible stroller, The Piper a couple weeks ago. It's about $450, plus another $150 or so for the second seat. The rellay appealing part to me is that it already comes with attachments for many popular carsest options and the stroller seat itself converts to a bassinet! So saving a lot of money on less attachments and saving room on storage as well 

BUT it's brand new, I can't find any safety ratings and there's No WAY for me to know how it is? If anyone likes it!

Ever since I had started feeling the baby move inside and ever since I‚Äôd seen the baby in the 3D ultrasound, I‚Äôve never felt that the baby isn‚Äôt a human already. I think it‚Äôs just inside me rather than outside and I need to take care of myself so it can come out safely.

Before 2 years or so, I‚Äôve never particularly liked babies. I don‚Äôt know why, maybe I just didn‚Äôt feel too motherly. My mum is a great mum and I just never felt like I could be anything like her and that I just didn‚Äôt have it in me. But since I got pregnant, all I can think of is babies. I like all babies: babies in the streets in their strollers, babies on Instagram and all babies everywhere. I even dreamt a baby in my sleep last night. It was so cute and it was smiling at me.

I feel restless and want to meet my baby. I hope it will have a place in this world. And I miss it even though I‚Äôve never met it and it isn‚Äôt born yet. Is this me being a weirdo or are there others out here who experience such strange feelings too?

Thanks to whoever has read this. Here‚Äôs a prayer to all the women here who are going to be mothers or are wanting to be mothers ü§≤ I wish you all good health and a smooth journey!",1738507063.0,1ifyjhr

babybumps,First Pregnancy Ontario - Family Doctor/OB/Midwife,"Hi all, this is my first pregnancy and husband and I are very excited but very overwhelmed by the information available and what our next steps should be. We just found out (2-3 weeks pregnant) and have bookef an appointment with out family doctor.

Here are our questions. If someone could please briefly explain:

- Does the Family Doctor prescribe prenatal vitamins or should I buy them OTC?
- Am I supposed to choose between my doctor/ an OB/ a midwife as my primary health care provider or just go to my doctor and she provides a referral?
- can I choose my OB myself? If so, how does that work?
- do I need a midwife?
- I do not have a support system present so I was thinking about doulas. Are they different than midwives? How can I go about working with one?
- when do we get out first ultrasound?

Anything else I need to know?

babybumps,Mindset advice for FTM who doesn‚Äôt feel strong enough for pregnancy,"I‚Äôm a FTM (32f) and have ADHD and anxiety. Despite this, I‚Äôve been weirdly calm about everything that could happen, good and bad, because I‚Äôm just trying to go with the flow and accept that I can‚Äôt control the majority of pregnancy symptoms and outcomes. 

This is where I need the advice.. 

I‚Äôm only around 6 weeks (I think 5wk5d but not sure), and I‚Äôm already having intense (all day) sickness and nausea. Luckily I‚Äôm not throwing up more than 4 times a day, but I can‚Äôt eat much so just slowly snacking away on apples or crackers etc to keep me going. 

I‚Äôm now spiralling that I‚Äôm just mentally not strong enough to be pregnant and that I‚Äôm a giant baby who can‚Äôt ‚Äúsuck it up‚Äù and is so exhausted, while everyone else seemed to just crack on. I try not to compare, but I‚Äôm the last of my friends to get pregnant, and despite everyone having a different experience, I feel like they dealt with it so much better. 

I‚Äôm so scared I‚Äôll be miserable and in pain the whole pregnancy, and I know it‚Äôs worth it, but I genuinely just don‚Äôt feel strong enough. Like how can I keep this up?? I know the first trimester is rough, but I feel like I can‚Äôt do it, let alone have multiple pregnancies. We also planned to get pregnant and now my brain is also spiralling like ‚Äúyou chose this and are lucky you got pregnant, so deal with it.‚Äù 

Any advice on how to improve or work on my mindset? I will likely get therapy again if I keep spiralling, but any tips would be much appreciated.

PS - I have the most supportive partner in the world and I honestly cry thinking about how lucky I am with him (33m). He‚Äôs been my rock, and I just want to be strong for him and baby too.

Thank you üíú

EDIT: thank you all so much for your kind words, advice and support. Honestly cannot tell you how much better this has made me feel. I really appreciate it! 

TLDR; I‚Äôm a FTM who doesn‚Äôt feel mentally strong enough for pregnancy and need advice on how to improve my mindset.

babybumps,Vent husband,"Sorry if this comes off not articulate, I've been up all night. I definitely understand how fortunate I am to have a husband who is stepping up to do most chores around the house while I'm 22 weeks pregnant and taking care of our son with ASD most times in the afternoon after school when needed since being pregnant/very sick so far throughout. I appreciate this because I was single mom with my son for the first 5 years until I met him and we married 4 years later in august. However, I feel extremely alone as he gives all of his energy to work, and then it feels that he hides behind the chores or affection for my son (I know that sounds very selfish) and treats me with almost indifference and apathy. I feel that he sees me with such disgust and hatred since I've been pregnant and needed more help. I feel so repulsive and completely alone, I cry myself to sleep a lot lately.  I've shown appreciation for how much he is stepping up but also been very open to him and my doc about having a hard time off my medicine/having a difficult time with depression and panic attacks, and clear about just needing some affection or love, not just things done around me but not really interacting with me. It hurts when he tells me that I sleep a lot, I asked for affection and told me I want what is in Disney movies when I've said I was wanted to feel connected and gave some examples of things that would feel good right now because I really need the support. I tried to come onto him and he makes excuses, I feel awful about how I look. He is so good with my son who he has known for 5.5 years who has significant special needs and I see the love they have, I wish I could feel any amount of that from him as well, he's a phenomenal dad and I deeply appreciate this, I also feel I am just a vessel for bringing his daughter into the world but there isn't much more about me, I feel so alone and deeply sad, I've spoken many times about this and nothing changes, I feel very bad so please don't be too harsh.

So I had my baby 10/25/24 and always thought I‚Äôd have my mom and man in the delivery room. That was the plan. I was induced so I knew it would be a while and told my mom to keep her phone on and I‚Äôd call her when shit got real, that was at like 7p then around 5a, shit for real. Called her in tears and asked her to come quickly. She lives about 35 mins from the hospital so I knew it would take a little while. She showed up 4.5 hours later. 

By that time, I didn‚Äôt NEED her anymore. I was pretty let down. By 10a it was time to start pushing and had everyone leave, including her. So that was the first let down. I needed her there in the early stages while I was trying to get through contractions with out and epidural. She showed up well after the epidural. 

So that was the first let down. Now my guy is here and thriving after he nearly killed us both (5 days in the hospital for me and 5 days nicu for him) and he is 3 months and so very healthy. 

Now I‚Äôm looking for help in the mornings, I work from home in the am and head into the office in the pm. So like 8-2 at home, 3-5 in office, it‚Äôs flexible and I make my own schedule but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm used to. I asked my mom if she could watch him 2-3 days a week from 9-1pm, while I have other family helping other days. I thankfully can bring him with me to work so I just need help so I can bust ass in the morning and get shit done. 

Verbatim she told me ‚ÄúI already raised my kids‚Äù ‚Ä¶. She was depressed and in bed my entire life. I just hung up. 

I feel hurt and confused bc we‚Äôve never fought like this. She hasn‚Äôt worked in years and other family members are so willing and less able to help but so willing to give their time.  

My mom doesn‚Äôt seem to care but expects her time with my baby. I dont know what to do. She says she‚Äôs willing to help when she can and I shouldn‚Äôt block her out. But I‚Äôm not blocking her out, I‚Äôm finding people to rely on.

I called my OB and was told my first appointment is at 8 weeks. So, for the next 4 weeks I just wait without knowing everything is normal/progressing? Do people ever continue to take pregnancy tests to make sure it stays positive during this period of time? ",1738467265.0,1ifo8dp

babybumps,Mourning the pregnancy I thought I‚Äôd have,"I am writing this at 4am from the hospital. I can‚Äôt go back to sleep after being woken up at 3 am for a vitals check/blood draw. I‚Äôm a STM with an amazing 2 year old at home and I‚Äôm 26 + 4 with a complete placenta previa. 

I found out about the previa at my Anatomy scan at 20 weeks and was put on pelvic rest. Well yesterday I was woken up at 4am to a ton of bleeding so I immediately went to L&D. They checked me, bleeding had slowed down and was stopping, but they wanted me to be near a nicu just in case so they transferred me by ambulance to another local hospital that had a nicu. That was at like 6 am. I‚Äôve been here ever since and luckily the bleeding has stopped, baby is good, and I should be going home at some point today. 

I was told that I‚Äôll be on a modified bed rest when I go home and if I bleed again, I have to come back and stay until I have the baby (hopefully around 36w). If I bleed a 3rd time while I‚Äôm here, baby is coming out that day. I‚Äôm just so sad. I‚Äôve been very active this pregnancy, as I was with my last, and now I have to basically stop everything. I won‚Äôt be able to pick up my toddler. I won‚Äôt be able to walk my dogs. My husband will have to do everything. 

I know this is temporary and I‚Äôll do what I have to do to keep me and my baby safe, but I‚Äôm so upset. This isn‚Äôt how I wanted my last pregnancy to go. I‚Äôm terrified now every time I go to the bathroom I‚Äôll be bleeding again. I don‚Äôt want to live in a hospital for 6+ weeks with a toddler at home I‚Äôll barely get to see. 

This is just a rant. If you‚Äôre still here, thanks for letting me get it out. Down bad crying at the hospital at 4 am. ",1738400352.0,1if2e1g

babybumps,First time mom- will I need help? My,"Hi all, we‚Äôre due in August with our first and very excited. Experienced moms please give your advice. We‚Äôre trying to understand if I can realistically expect to care for the baby solo during husbands longer 12 hour shifts in case of complications with the following factors: 

- My husband won‚Äôt have paternity leave and we‚Äôre doing our best to put in vacations around the due date so he can be home with me a little more the first month or two. His role is critical so he can‚Äôt leave to pop home at all unless it‚Äôs a serious emergency. 

- We don‚Äôt have the ability to bring in a friend or family member to help in the early days with the baby. 

- I‚Äôm 37 and that puts me at increased risk for c-section.

- I‚Äôm not too sure having a stranger come in & help a couple days a week when husbands on doubles would feel comfortable so I‚Äôd like to avoid it unless that‚Äôs crazy. 

I typically have a delusional belief that I can do anything‚Ä¶ but can I do this solo with the baby the first month while husbands away long hours if we have a c-section or natural birth?

babybumps,Pregnant with severe back pain from scoliosis,"I am currently 29 weeks pregnant and have been experiencing severe back pain due to sitting at a desk for my office job 8hrs a day. I'm talking can barely walk and the idea of standing up makes me want to cry kind of pain. All day long. 

I've had scoliosis my whole life and back pain my whole life because of it. It causes significant muscle weakness in my right side as well as tension headaches from the way my spine pulls on my shoulder muscles. I wasn't officially diagnosed with scoliosis until 2 years ago when I finally sought some answers. 

This is my fourth pregnancy and by far the worst back pain I've had to deal with. Because of the type of scoliosis I have unfortunately standing does not relieve the pain either. 

I guess I'm just expressing my frustrations at this point as I still have two months to go until my maternity leave starts and I genuinely don't know how I'm going to do it. 

Can doctors extend disability for back pain? I would guess probably not since it‚Äôs fairly common right?

babybumps,My nausea is stress related and that makes me more stressed...,"TW: Pet illness, stress, nausea

I'm 28F, 15 weeks pregnant with my first baby and feel like everything in my life is falling apart and I'm the most stressed I've maybe ever been in my life. My parents seem to be splitting up and I've always felt very responsible for their pain and for helping them through difficult situations. I also just learned that my 10 year old cat has a heart condition that will probably limit his remaining lifespan to about a year, during which he'll be on 3 medications daily and my heart is breaking. On top of all that I have a phobia of vomiting and have been vomiting multiple times per week since 8 weeks.

Last week I went on a vacation with my husband and I was able to eat normally and go on walks and just feel like a human again for the first time in months. I didnt throw up a single time while we were away. Before we left for the trip I was able to eat the equivalent of maybe one meal per day and was throwing up every couple days, but severely nauseous 24/7. During the trip I was so hoping I had turned a corner, but the day after we got home my cat was diagnosed with his heart condition and i threw up from the stress later that day. I'm back to eating maybe 1.5 meals per day (and hating every second of it), laying on the couch nonstop, and throwing up at random, and I'm realizing that this is probably all stress related at this point. It's great to know why I'm feeling so physically awful, but I can't will the stress away which just makes me panic even more because none of the stress is going away any time soon. I'm in therapy once a week which is so so helpful, but only while I'm there. As soon as I hang up I'm alone and scared and nauseous again. All I want is to be able to call my parents for support but they're each individually so miserable right now that they don't have it in them to help me, and i dont want to end up comforting them instead. My husband wants to help but he is heartbroken and stressed about our cat, too, to the point where he is also nauseous and not eating. 

I'm laying on the couch right now cuddled up with my two cats and this should be the least stressed I could possibly be, but my heart never stops pounding from anxiety and im afraid to stand up to take an anti-nausea medication because I'm so nauseous I'm afraid I'll throw up. I'm exhausted from crying and grieving and feeling sick, and I know stress is not good for baby either but like I can't escape the anxiety and the stressors that are causing it. I just need to fall apart for a minute and just get the burden of this pain and stress off my shoulders for a second. I feel like my emotional safety net from my husband and my parents is in tatters and I feel immense guilt for not being able to be their emotional safety net either. I feel like i have no tears left, no energy left, and no productivity left, and I'm just a scared broken person trying to grow a baby while incapable of doing anything else. I've lost some of the excitement of even meeting the baby because 6 months passing to my due date also feels like a countdown clock on my cats life and having to grieve him. I feel so drowned by all of this and stuck frozen on the couch. ",1738458420.0,1ifli8o

I'm just trying to make some sense of this loss. I need to understand what might have caused this so I can make sure it never happens again.

I'm 30 and this was my first pregnancy, in the early stages of pregnancy I had some bleeding at 5 - 6 weeks and we found a as a subchorionic hematoma. Although in the later scans it seemed to have resolved.

The 20 week scan was mostly perfect, my son was perfect. My cervical length was reported to be 40 mm The placenta was posterior, clear from the Cervix. The only two comments were:

A 65 x 16 x 51mm placental lake was present on the inferior margin of the placenta remote from the cord insertion.

And an additional placental lake was located centrally within the placental mass 15 x 10 x 19mm.

I was told this is not a big concern but we would continue to monitor bubs growth.

However at 23 weeks at 2 days I noticed a five cent piece sized mucus plug.

Then at 23 weeks at 3 days 10am I started having what I thought was irritable uterus contractions, I was at work and the pain was pretty mild but they consistent. Called my midwife and she advised when I got home from work to have a warm bath and Panadol. I kept updating her about the contractions throughout the day and she didn‚Äôt seem to be too concerned. At 2pm I asked my midwife I should go to the hospital instead of going home which was 40minutes away from the hospital. She didn‚Äôt think that was necessary and told me to update her once I‚Äôd had a bath and Panadol. The contractions seemed to stop for an hour while I had a bath, but they returned by 5pm. She then advised me to go to hospital. I sat in a waiting room for an hour and when they check me they discovered my cervix was 3-4cm dilated and my waters were bulging. From there they started steroids, magnesium and another medication to try to hold off the labour, I sat in hospital for two days with the contractions however on the 21st of January my sons heart rate was dipping with the contractions and I was advised I needed to deliver him.

Once he was born he was rushed to the NICU. My son was 500gms and unfortunately sustained a perforation in his stomach and due to his fragility he would not have survived a surgery. He passed away peacefully on my chest 26/01/2025.

I just need to know what caused the preterm labour. I know that occasionally throughout my pregnancy I would have cramps after sex or orgasms so I wondered if I had an irritable uterus. I also wonder if I have a weak pelvic floor or core and if this could be a factor.

I would love to hear from anyone that had similar experiences, if anyone found any reason? What things I could investigate to try to understand, Or what was done for any future pregnancies?",1738455852.0,1ifknl3

babybumps,My friend and I are both pregnant and if sucks,"I (f25) and my friend (f25) have been friends for over 10 years. I‚Äôve known her longer than I‚Äôve known my husband so I like to think we are pretty tight. I found out I was pregnant in December after two years ttc and one miscarriage during this time. My husband and I were trying to get into a fertility clinic prior to finding out we are pregnant. I was super excited!! We (mostly) did it all naturally! I did have to have a progesterone induced period and had planned on it being my last cycle before starting monthly clomid and progesterone. I don‚Äôt have regular periods hence why we struggled. Anyway fast forward I am now 12 weeks pregnant and my friend is now 21 weeks pregnant. She has also expressed that her and her husband struggled but had tried for less than a year and ended up pregnant but that‚Äôs neither here more there. 

I am really struggling with being pregnant with her. Mostly because of feels like it a a competition. I feel like I can‚Äôt talk about my pregnancy and have to downplay everything because every time I talk about it, it‚Äôs ‚Äúoh I had it so much worse‚Äù ‚Äújust wait it gets worse‚Äù ‚Äújust wait for x,y,z, etc‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so lucky, I‚Äôm having [insert crazy off the wall symptom]‚Äù ‚Äúhopefully you don‚Äôt get gestational diabetes like me‚Äù‚ÄùI‚Äôm sick of rabbit food‚Äù and the list just goes on and on. I‚Äôm very grateful to have had a very easy pregnancy so far. Mild nausea, no throwing up, some tiredness but overall feeling decent physically. Mentally I‚Äôm not doing great. Im really struggling with depression and anxiety since getting pregnant so much so I‚Äôm starting an antidepressant and staying on it postpartum. This was apparently crazy to her. She looked at me like I was crazy and explained that the hormones can do that and it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot a big deal‚Äù and that medication could hurt the baby. I‚Äôm so sad that it feels this way. It seems like no matter what I say about my pregnancy I feel like I have to downplay everything about my pregnancy because I have it ‚Äúso easy compared to her‚Äù. She is constantly texting me every day about baby kicking and baby this, my body that, I‚Äôm sick of not eating carbs and ice cream and I just can‚Äôt deal with the mental stress of her competition of being better than me because she is farther along. I feel like I can‚Äôt even enjoy my pregnancy because of her. I was hoping pregnancy would bring us closer as friends but I want nothing more than to move out of the country and never see her again. 

Update: I ended up speaking to her about things and how I was feeling. It didn‚Äôt go well.. Even trying to have a discussion about me and how I was feeling it still circled back to her and how her pregnancy was basically more important because she was farther along. I have made the decision to remove her from my life as our friendship served me no purpose anymore. I wasn‚Äôt getting anything out of her, not even the basics of a friend, Support, love, respect, empathy, etc. I‚Äôm sad but also with her response it told me she had no real value on our friendship.

babybumps,Friend for part time childcare instead of daycare?,"I am currently 11 weeks pregnant and trying to plan an August-October maternity leave as a young teacher, which is not fun. I currently have just over 6 weeks of sick days built up which will become 7.5 weeks at the start of next school year, assuming I don't have to take any sick days before then üò¨. After that, I'll have to pay the school for healthcare since we don't get any paid time beyond PTO. (Short term disability wouldn't have made sense since it would require me to use up sick days first and then would stop at 8 weeks, so I'd get less than a week of 60% pay for the 14 months of premiums I would've had to pay since we got married.)

One of the teachers at school has a stay at home wife with an 8 month old and 2 year old and they live close to the school. I asked her if she'd be willing to do childcare and she was all for it, probably in part since I know they're on WIC with a single teachers salary and two kids. She genuinely seems to love being a mom, though, so I think that's part of it too. I wouldn't necessarily say we're close friends, but good enough acquaintances that we've been part of many group outings together over the past four years. I've seen enough of her interactions with her kids (and overheard dad's stories in the teacher's lounge) to know that she has a similar parenting style to what we're planning.

I'm meeting with our principal this week to discuss the potential for an 8 week maternity leave followed by a month of part time (only teaching one or two classes, but enough for me to get paid and the school to only have to pay a half day sub). This would get me to Thanksgiving break, and then I'd test out full time teaching in the three weeks until Christmas break.

More info: We plan on moving back to my hometown next summer, but are staying for now to use up my sick days for maternity leave (I would have to start over at a new school). Therefore, we'd move before the baby needs the social aspect of a daycare (and becomes more of a drain on the other mom).

Pros:
-Cost: Few daycares around here do daily part time care, and it's usually a large percentage of the full time rates. (I know it has to work that way for the daycare money wise, but it isn't great for me.) We're going to discuss rates once I know exactly how much the school will pay for part time.
-Location: I live on the outskirts of a college town but teach in a small town ~15 minutes away. Most daycares are in the bigger city which has terrible traffic and would have me driving the wrong way from school, adding a lot of commute time.

Cons:
-Licensing: Obviously, she isn't licensed or regulated like a daycare would be. I'm not sure what insurance should look like in case something happens while baby is in her care.
-Sick days: If either she or her kids get sick, we'd have to find help quickly (and writing sub plans sucks). Luckily, my husband's job hours are flexible if needed occasionally, but if this started happening multiple times per month, that may not look great to his boss.

Questions:
What other factors aren't I considering?
How much is reasonable per hour for child care in a small Midwest town? Should this change as the child grows and isn't sleeping all the time?
Any teachers experienced with an August maternity leave? I would come back to teach my AP class first since middle school math and science classes are WAY harder and more draining.

I know the Internet is usually very against friends taking care of your kids. Is this a time that would actually make sense?",1738450914.0,1ifixp8

babybumps,I‚Äôm pregnant at 20 and don‚Äôt know what to do,"Hi everyone - I made a post on here a few weeks back but deleted it due to the worry of my boyfriend finding out about it but realised that I need as much advice and support I can get as possible right now.

So for some context I found out nearly 4 weeks ago now that I‚Äôm pregnant. 

Me and my boyfriend have been together for less than a year and didn‚Äôt really take any precautions when it came to using protection as it had never been an issue for me before in previous relationships one of the main reasons being that I have PCOS.

Before discovering the pregnancy our relationship was going well, minor a few hiccups about trust and him not agreeing with certain mistakes that I made in the past.

We had discussed around the start of our relationship what would happen if I suddenly got pregnant and I said that I would get an abortion but since finding out that i am pregnant I feel different about that decision.

Our relationship has never been under so much strain since this and ever since I told him he‚Äôs not stopped going on about getting an abortion and has given me many reasons on why I ‚Äúhave‚Äù to.

His reasons consist of us both being young, not having careers yet (we‚Äôre both in university), not having our own place yet, financial struggles and him not feeling ready to become a dad which I completely understand.

So I even said to him what if I raised our child on my own? And he told me that he simply couldn‚Äôt live with it and would have to end his own life because he couldn‚Äôt cope with being a dad that hates his child and isn‚Äôt there for them.

He has been pressuring me since we first found out and it‚Äôs seriously taken a toll on my mental health. I‚Äôve reached out to my mother, who has been incredibly supportive in this situation and is aware that I would rather keep the baby and would help me raise the child.

In addition, this week I had my first midwife appointment and both my boyfriend and my mom decided to accompany me. The midwife was really friendly and supportive but my boyfriend completely freaked out and was really unhappy and anxious afterwards with the thought of me keeping the baby.

He instantly asked afterwards if I was keeping it or not but because of his pressure and telling me that I‚Äôm being completely unlogical and insane and setting myself up for a life on government support if I keep this child.

We have also previously talked about our future together before all of this, he said he wanted to marry me and have a family with me, you know, build a life together and when I asked him again since finding out  he said if I get an abortion now things will be ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù in two years time and he‚Äôd be all for having the baby and wouldn‚Äôt make me get an abortion ever again.

He hasn‚Äôt told any of his friends or even his parents due to the shame and judgement that he might receive but it‚Äôs taking a toll on him too.

I really wish things could be easier and he‚Äôs simply taken away my thoughts and feelings towards this and I told him that but he says that he should have an equal say in this as it‚Äôs his baby too.

When I tell him it‚Äôs my body my choice he doesn‚Äôt get it at all and said keeping the baby would ruin both of our lives forever.

I feel so lost and every time I think about getting an abortion I get so upset and emotional but I know it‚Äôs probably for the best and I feel like it has to be done.",1738445607.0,1ifgzrx

babybumps,Mom Died and as a FTM I'm Heartbroken about a Baby Shower,"*I'm not sure where to go with this post but just felt like writing this as an outlet and maybe get some advice from other redditors.*

  
My mom passed away 5 months ago after a year long battle with cancer and I found out I was unexpectedly pregnant a few weeks afterwards. The beginning of my pregnancy wasn't the joyous occasion I had always envisioned. For context, my mom was diagnosed with Stage 4 endometrial cancer that had spread to her brain, lungs, and liver the week after my wedding while my husband and I were on our honeymoon. We came home to a stark new reality of cancer treatments and caregiving rather than newlywed bliss. After she had passed, I was expecting to spend time grieving and trying to feel like myself again. Instead, I was thrown into a nauseous filled first trimester and grappling with this life change. As time goes by, I'm becoming more and more excited about this baby and feel like my mom had something to do with the timing as she was so ready to be a grandmother.

  
Grief comes in waves but I'm starting to feel so much worse when thinking and talking about a baby shower. It makes me feel so alone in pregnancy without her. She would have been so excited and would be overjoyed to celebrate the baby and me becoming a mother. My best friend has offered to host something which is so sweet but I'm starting to wonder who would even come. I'm not sure my mom's friends who mostly live out of town would come as my mom obviously won't be there. My MIL has said that she doesn't want to host something and it's a big shower person (which is fine as I know she will be very involved once the baby arrives) but her calendar also has no free weekends this Spring. I only have two aunts who are local from my family. I'm not sure who from my husband's sisters, aunts or cousins would come either. I have a small group of friends- most of whom are a flight away and I wouldn't expect them to come either. 

I'm so torn as I can't imagine having a baby shower without my mom and it would be very emotional and I feel sad that my first baby won't be celebrated if I choose not to have one. If I do choose to have one, I'm also sensitive to the reality that maybe no one will be there... Any advice or moms who have been in similar situations?",1738436220.0,1ifdg5r

My partner and I are reviewing family planning costs one by one as I'm very anxious about being financially dependent on him (history of financial abuse with parents). There is a chance I may not be able to work due to medical conditions while trying or pregnant (working with doctors on this). In order for me to be ok with relying on him we are going through each topic. He's great with this, it's just me needing to feel ok with his support. 

Tomorrow we are discussing pregnancy costs. I'm not talking about baby supplies, more what id have to increase for me to be comfortable and healthy while pregnant. I'm in Canada. 

Here's the main groups I have so far:
- med changes (may actually save money here)
- new vitamins and supplements
- ovulation tracking and pregnancy test stuff
- clothing (work, comfy, winter gear, under garments, pj's)
- increased treatment (massage, chiro, pelvic physio, trigger point injections, mental health) 
- travel insurance with increases (we have family in the US and visit frequently) 
- other medical equipment?
- Ubers to appointments if I can't drive.
- prenatal yoga class (or something to keep active and meet other moms)
- parenting or other classes. 

What else did you need for you? Is there any equipment or supports you found necessary (I have chronic pain and some mobility issues hence the possibility I may not be able to work). Any pampering products that made things easier?

First trimester -- 
- immediately weight gain and bloat
- lots of naps and fatigue 
- super sensitive breasts (even to wearing bras) until about week 12ish. 
- no cravings (which I don't mind but annoying to answer this question when people ask) 

Second trimester was pretty much a breeze. Towards the end of second and third -- 

- my iron levels dropped. I am still on an iron supplement every other day 
- I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes / diet controlled still at 37 weeks. I prick my finger 4x a day for the last 12 weeks.
- up about 20-24lbs

- I do not have a pregnancy glow. I have been getting hormonal breakouts or acne 
- I have skin tags that I'm hoping goes away after birth lolol 
- my hair is not the healthiest or super shiny. I feel like I've had some hair loss and it looks dull and dry.
- I'm definitely noticing more fluid retention from sitting too long or standing too long

When I first found out I was pregnant, I was very worried that my life would stop and everything would become about the child. The book kind of reconfirmed for me that that did not have to be the case, and that my needs / our needs as the adults and parents also matter. 

Anyway, what are others thoughts on the book and incorporating it into real life? Especially in an American context, where (I feel) there is a lot of pressure to give your child all the attention, all the time.

I'm at the start of this but I don't want it to progress further (my friend told me horror stories about hemroids). My doctors closed until Monday. Is there anything natural I can do?

No other alarming symptoms (except awful gas cramps after I eat). I also have a history of bleeding once in a while after sex once in a while (I got a scan in October for this and all was normal) so part of  me is wondering if my cervix is super sensitive right now.

babybumps,False positive test and I am devastated,"I went to urgent care for dehydration and was told I had a positive urine test. I was over the moon beyond happy. I have noticed a ton of changes in my body - sore boobs, weird cramps/discharge, hormonal, etc. - so it all started to come together and I was thrilled. 

After the positive test at urgent care, I took an at-home one which came out negative. I didn‚Äôt stress since I knew I was very early and assumed urgent care had higher quality tests than the one I was in a bind and had to buy. 

Went to OBGYN, another negative urine test followed by a negative blood test. 

I‚Äôm devastated. It felt so real. I am so worried I won‚Äôt be able to have this happen for real again.

babybumps,Just had a traumatic experience at the hospital and really need some support.,"Also posted in r/pregnant as I‚Äôm just looking for any support at all. 

I‚Äôm 33w3d. I came into ED last night having shortness of breath, reduced fetal movement, chest pain, feeling very faint etc. They did tests and scans, and I have a pulmonary embolism. I was terrified of this, and hemorrhaging - both of which are now big risks. I have to have painful blood thinning shots in my leg twice a day, and they need to teach me how to do it as I now will be doing it at home for the next three months. It‚Äôs looking like an induction which I also didn‚Äôt want so I‚Äôm going to talk about a c section instead as that is also an option. 

Anyway, after being admitted for my PE, I started having intense cramping pain above my pubic bone and they needed to assess if I was dilating and so they did a check with a speculum, like a pap smear. The OB did his job and due diligence, and I was going okay, breathing deep and relaxing, generally taking like a champ as I‚Äôm not squeamish in hospital environments. But then as he swabbed my cervix I got 100000/10 pain, immediately like being stabbed with a hot knife. I screamed uncontrollably like an animal and was begging for them to stop. My husband said it all happened very quickly but the midwife explained they can‚Äôt just yank out the speculum or they‚Äôd pinch the cervix and pain would be worse.  It felt like it lasted a million years. I would‚Äôve done anything to stop the pain. 

I was uncontrollably sobbing in a way I have never experienced in my entire life.  The tears just poured and poured out of me. The OB was very professional but clearly deeply worried about my distress. They both comforted me a lot and have given me strong pain relief. 

It‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs fault, and the OB was apologising for causing me distress but I felt so violated. Not by him, just by the event. And the powerless feeling of screaming ‚ÄúSTOP STOP‚Äù and it not stopping - there are no words.

I sobbed for half an hour after and couldn‚Äôt speak - I just sort of stared. I had a shower but I still feel very shaken and sick. They think I may have an infection which contributed to the severity of the pain. When I apologised for the hysteria the midwife said ‚ÄúNo. Do not apologise. As women we are so often not taken seriously or play down the pain but these checks are absolutely awful and I have seen many many women react the same way. You are totally normal.‚Äù She stayed by my bedside wiping my tears for twenty minutes to help calm me down. My husband has been a rock here with me and has not left my side once in the entire time we‚Äôve been here. 

My baby is moving a lot so they‚Äôre struggling to get a decent read on her for the last 24 hours but she doesn‚Äôt appear distressed and I can feel her moving so I asked them to take the belly bands off. 

I feel so traumatised by today. I have had cancer and I have endometriosis so hospitals aren‚Äôt a new environment for me although I don‚Äôt love them. I can handle being here. But that was just horrendous and it keeps playing over and over in my head, the pain and my scream. 

Has anybody had a similar experience??

TLDR - I have a pulmonary embolism, have to have painful shots every day, my baby is acting up, I have a possible cervical infection and am feeling totally violated and traumatised by a cervical check that had me screaming in animalistic agony I‚Äôve never experienced before.

babybumps,Regretting my Induction,"This is mostly a rant since I‚Äôm starting to panic, and I need to let it out somewhere. 

I‚Äôm 39+6 today. I had no medical reason that required an induction. My doctor brought it up at my past few appointments and said they don‚Äôt like women going too far past their due date (even though I‚Äôm a FTM, and I know most of us statistically do go past our due dates). 

My pregnancy has generally been smooth with no major complications except godawful anxiety. I have been terrified of something going wrong and especially of stillbirth. So when induction was brought up, I weighed my options and decided to agree to it. 

Well I‚Äôve had two rounds of the prostaglandin gel already, and my cervix hasn‚Äôt opened much. Barely 1cm and baby is still high so they can‚Äôt break my water. I‚Äôm having minor contractions. I‚Äôm really disappointed this isn‚Äôt going anywhere. They said they‚Äôll try the balloon next and then we might be able to try the gel again tomorrow or I can opt for a C section, which I really wanted to avoid. 

I was feeling very calm and positive when I got here, but I‚Äôm just so upset right now.

I know it‚Äôs possible at the first scan to be measured behind, but this isn‚Äôt quite my scenario and the doctors are saying to have cautious optimism. 

I was tracking closely with opks so I knew when I ovulated. 

1/17- I should be 6week 2 days, measured CRL 5 weeks 6 days - no concerns (technician with better equipment)

One week later measured 6 weeks 2 days with a heartbeat of 95

Exactly two weeks later- I was measuring 7 weeks +-2 days based on a few measurements. I should be at least 7weeks 6 days from the first appointment. Heartbeat at 135

So they concluded baby is measuring behind and they do have some concerns but it could just be totally ok.

I‚Äôve come to terms with it a lot quicker since I‚Äôm carrying the baby but my partner seems to be on a complete stand still. He doesn‚Äôt want to talk about having the baby and actively avoids it. He thinks his life is ruined and he‚Äôll never have any money and his future he planned has completely perished. I on the other hand know our immediate plans have changed but we can still accomplish what we want to later in life. 

I sympathise with him but I also feel like he‚Äôs being selfish about it. Saying things like ‚ÄúMy life is ruined‚Äù ‚ÄúI wanted to travel in my early 20‚Äôs‚Äù self centred kind of things. 

I told him that it hurt my feelings because we‚Äôre going through the same situation and that I felt like I was having to be the strong one, when I shouldn‚Äôt be? It should be both of us‚Ä¶in a way I felt like I‚Äôve ruined his life and that it‚Äôs my fault‚Ä¶it makes me feel very isolated.

It all started at 13 weeks when I had a bleed, it was red blood mixed with clear liquid. I went to A&E and baby was doing great with a strong heartbeat. The bleeding stopped after 30/40 minutes and I had a swab taken which came out with old brown blood on the cotton tip. The A&E dr told me not to worry as they had done 3 scans in 3 hours I was admitted, including a more in depth scan with a radiologist and baby was fine. They gave me progesterone via injection and also tablet form to take home for the next week.

I went to see my main Dr the next day as my bleeding started again but this time it was brown. She did another scan and baby was doing fine still with a strong heartbeat at 160bpm. She told me to take progesterone for the next 2 weeks and she booked me in for my regular check up in 4 weeks. I‚Äôve had no bleeding since. 

I have been feeling pains but not cramping pain, more like lighting shocks that last 2/3 seconds at most. But now everything that I feel has me feeling so much anxiety and dread. I keep dreaming that I‚Äôll turn up to my next appointment and be told my baby has no heartbeat. 

I‚Äôve spoken to my husband about it casually but he thinks I‚Äôm just worrying because of my past 2 miscarriages and says that the baby will be fine but I‚Äôm struggling to stay positive.

babybumps,Scared of cervical ripening for induction,"I‚Äôm currently 38+3 FTM and getting ready to be induced for GDM. Based off my last cervical check which was yesterday, my cervix is not ripening and not really dilating. I am someone who has a low pain tolerance to begin with but I also have sexual and medical trauma so something as simple as a pelvic exam will send me into a panic and also causes extreme pain. They want me to come in the day before for cervical ripening and they keep pushing for me to do so with a Foley catheter. However, the whole process of shoving a catheter through an unopened cervix and rapidly inflating it seems completely barbaric. Just the thought alone has my anxiety through the roof. Now I am aware there are other options and after doing extensive research on all the methods personally I feel the method of using an oral ripener would work best for me. I do understand why the foley is the preferred method though. Not only will it help as I transition from early to active labor but, with every method available, there is a risk of over stimulating the uterus. If you ripen medicinally then your team has to race against the clock to try and counteract the medication and there‚Äôs no way you can take it back once you start where as with the catheter you can simple deflate the balloon and pull it out. I‚Äôm unsure of what to do and or how to calm myself down. All of the anxiety has me regretting every single choice I‚Äôve made that has lead me here and begging to wake up from this nightmare. Ffs I‚Äôm starting to even second guess if I want to be a mom or not even though I‚Äôve wanted nothing more since I was a child. Has anyone had to be ripened either by Foley catheter or oral medication? And if so what was it like? How painful was it?

babybumps,increase my dose of Zoloft,"Hello everyone 
I am currently 29 weeks (almost 30), my OB put me on a very low dose of Zoloft (25 mg) that I started taking for more than 2 weeks now because was feeling really anxious from week 25, and it was very hard for me to calm down ... although it's helping me I still have pics of anxiety from time to time (sometimes for no apparent reason, just my heart starts beating faster- probably the hormones)... I have always been an anxious person, but never needed medication to calm myself, but during this pregnancy, it's different. In addition to Zoloft I also  reduce anxiety by doing pregnancy pilates and workout + meditation, which also  helps a lot... I take the 25 mg of Zoloft in the morning then I feel good until around 5 pm then the anxiety comes back... I am then able to control it with the workouts... before sleeping I take  240mg of magnesium glycinate and I usually sleep well (even if I wake up sometimes to pee and I feel some anxiety, I am usually able to go back to sleep)... My ob is suggesting to augment the dose to 50 mg per day , I am hesitating, but at the same time I am tired to be on survival mode everyday. Basically, everyday I do everything to reduce stress to make sure I am not hurting my baby. Any experience on Zoloft ? Did you also feel the need to augment your dose as the pregnancy progressed ?

So I started wearing my smartwatch again and sure enough, my bpm would go from a restful 95 to 130 when I sat still at work. 

I‚Äôve had my bpm spike as high as 140-155 more than once and I brought this up with my OB. They said I had normal blood pressure when they check at my appointments and she wasn‚Äôt concerned.

I‚Äôve felt awful and it‚Äôs gotten progressively worse as my bpm will stay at 125-135 for hours before dropping again even if I lay down or stand up. I get so dizzy and lightheaded that I get confused.

My OB sent me down to Urgent Care because she said I probably had a cold. Urgent Care saw my symptoms and ordered a 24 hour Holter Monitor to see what my heart rate was doing and to get a better idea. I‚Äôm still waiting on those results.

It‚Äôs been 8(?) weeks since my blood pressure has been spiking and my symptoms have only increased and gotten worse. I no longer feel comfortable driving and I can‚Äôt help but cry when my OB tells me that I‚Äôm fine and it‚Äôs normal.

babybumps,1 year of TTC,"So my Fiancee & I been trying to conceive for a year now, we started trying on New Years Day of last year, & yesterday she got her period again.

We both want kids, I been a chain smoker for about 5 years now, been smoking cigarettes since I was a teenager, plus I been smoking cannabis since I was a teenager, as well, also we both drink alcohol (usually beer), she drinks twice a week, but I usually drink a beer or two throughout the week.

She was just told by her doctor, that she might be pre-diabetic, as she currently weighs 280 pounds, & she is a little shorter than I, she thinks her being a bit overweight might be contributing to the difficulty of getting pregnant.

She did say that if she doesn't get pregnant by 37 (she's almost 35, I will be 26 next month), she will do IVF.

I just feel like the months go by fast, & the more the months pass by, the more likely I see us having a baby is going to be likely.

And, she is a little over 5 years from being 40, so I know for women, after 40 pregnancy can get more complicated, I want to be a father before 30, but I know that being with an older woman, that there isn't that much time left.

My mother got pregnant with me around 31, I'm the oldest of four children, she had 2 miscarriages (one before my sister was born, & the other one before my youngest sister was born), she had my youngest sister around 48 years old, & my youngest sister has developmental disabilities (I have Aspergers myself, & My fiancee has NVLD from a traumatic brain injury at birth)

My fiancees mother had two miscarriages, one few years before my fiancee was born, & the other one when my fiancee was around 2 years old, my fiancees mother had my fiancee when she was 40.

We are open to adoption, if pregnancy isn't a option in the long run, as much as I want a biological child with my own DNA, I know that there are many children that need a loving family & home.

I did all the tests because it was 100% covered. I had a traumatic labor and delivery that would have cost a LOT. 

As soon as you find out you are pregnant, notify your PCP at the VA. They will connect you with a maternity care coordinator. They will help schedule your first appointment and be the go between with your community care and the VA. The VA pays for everything. I did all the testing, like NIPT, because everything was covered. If you have a bill that kicks back, let the maternity care coordinator know and they will take care of it. I had a bill that kept coming back to me even two years later, and I just got notified that it was paid.

Having a baby is expensive. I hope this can help at least a few moms lessen the burden.

I need advice. I am 36 weeks and 1 day today and my doctor told me I can choose to have a natural birth or a c section. I don‚Äôt technically have a medically necessary reason to have a c section, but asked if I could have one if I felt better about it and he said yes. 

I am a first time mom with immense fear of delivering naturally because of the horrors my mother, grandma and sister went through during their labors and eventual emergency c sections. All of them had a pelvis too small to deliver naturally despite trying to do so. I obviously know everyone is different and their bodies are too, but I feel that is a risk I‚Äôm not wanting to take if I can help it.

Edit: I phrased it wrong by saying c section would be taking it the ‚Äúeasy way‚Äù out. By no means do I think it would be easy by a long shot.

I‚Äôm not sure he truly wanted me to be pregnant as his response when I told him was basically ‚Äúare you sure? Those tests could be wrong. Sometimes it‚Äôs a false positive and you. Old have a miscarriage‚Äù. 
When it came time to go to my first ultrasound appt at 9 weeks, he had been sick the days before and we had a meeting with our banker which stressed him out. So he was in a pretty bad mood. I recognized this and offered multiple times through the day that he could stay and work. He didn‚Äôt need to come to this appointment if he wasn‚Äôt feeling up to it. I also mentioned I want ‚Äúgood vibes‚Äù at the ultrasound and wanted it to be an exciting and happy occasion, so if he couldn‚Äôt get out of his funk then it was ok for him to stay. He told me he wanted to come because he‚Äôs trying to support me. So. We went. 
On the ride to the office he was still grumpy. Talking about all the things that were difficult for him. How is job is difficult. How he feels like we don‚Äôt have any money. How he works so hard and doesn‚Äôt get anywhere and I asked him if we could change the subject because he was bringing me down and I could tell he was getting more upset. Finally I started crying and said ‚ÄúI told you you could stay home if you didn‚Äôt feel like coming and being positive‚Äù.l and explained that at 9 weeks pregnant I don‚Äôt have the emotional patience for this conversation right before our ultrasound.  His response was ‚Äúfine just drop me off and I‚Äôll start walking home. I have people who I can call that will pick me up‚Äù. This was when we were about 20 miles from our house‚Ä¶
So I cried more and said that wasn‚Äôt helping. He yelled about him going to try to support me and what else could he do to support me. I told him it would help if he stopped talking. He replied fine. And that he wouldn‚Äôt talk the rest of the trip.
We sat in silence the remaining 20 minutes except for me crying and one attempt to explain to him that I don‚Äôt want to be crying and to feel uncontrollable emotions. And how much I wish he could just understand how much hormones do to a person in the first trimester especially. What sucks is this is our 3rd pregnancy. You think he‚Äôd know‚Ä¶

babybumps,Scared about Postpartum Mental Health/Anxiety - Any recs?,"I'm sure most of the answers to this will be that there is no way to know how my body / mind will react to postpartum, but just reaching for any help/suggestions/tips I can get..
I am 32 weeks pregnant and somehow have been the most level-headed non-anxious version of myself since before my teenage years, something even my husband noticed and commented on the other day. I think it's because I'm not going through the monthly hormone cycle of my period. This leads me to start worrying a bit now about the crash that is awaiting me in less than 8 weeks.
I am 35 years old and the last of a dozen+ friends (including twin sister) to have a baby, and have seen a couple friends go through some scary things postpartum in terms of mental health and anxiety. A lot of their mental health problems were related to breastfeeding, so I have educated myself as much as possible and have asked my husband to please tell me to switch to formula if he sees it affecting me in a big way.

babybumps,Is your baby encephalopathic?,"My baby has Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy, we still do not know the cause. She had a normal EEG at 6 weeks old but had abnormal brain waves with multifocal spikes during two 2 day EEGS at 3 month's and 4 month's of age. There were no seizures recorded but the Doctors told us she is at risk for developing them as this is ""seizure-like"" activity. She is currently on Keppra and we are weaning off Phenobarbital. Our Epileptologist does not have a prognosis for us as we still do not know the cause. All tests (MRI's, CT's, X-rays, metabolic) have come back normal, with no indication of injury or abnormalities. Genetics is our only lead. An epilepsy panel came back with 5 uncertain genes possibly related but they were hetero and not dominant so cannot be the cause. We will be continuing down genetics though to see if we can pin point a cause.

The reason I am posting is because I am struggling with this situation. All I see on media are normal healthy babies and lots of ""How to help your baby grow"" and ""Things to do with your baby"". 

Encephalopathy means the brain is ""angry"" and not processing things. My baby girl is 5 months old about to be 6 months and is very developmentally behind. She scored a 1 on all skills with Early Intervention. Her eyes and ears are structurally normal and working but her brain does not process what she sees or hears. 

I feel stuck and don't know how to help her, I can't do the normal things others would do with their little ones because she does not respond to sounds or toys. The only thing Early Intervention will likely be able to help with is her motor skills (probably only lifting her head and rolling over). I let them know they will not be able to use toys as motivators, she does not respond to toys at all. The only thing she semi responds to is tactile and textures.

I have seen videos of other babys with development delays or seizure disorders. Their little ones still do more then my girl is able to do. They were at least able to look at their parents and respond to their voice or their motor skills were not far behind. 

I don't know if she truly recognizes me as her mom. Her eyes will dart towards my voice sometimes when a stranger is holding her, but thats the only sign I have. We are told we will have to wait and for her brain to start processing things, but we don't know why she is encephalopathic or how long she will be. We need to be on the look out for infantile spasms (a type of seizure associated with her diagnosis). 

Has anyone else delt with a similar situation? Or has anyone had an encephalopathic baby whose brain was not processing these things? How did you help them or get through it while waiting for changes?

I am on a constant roller coaster of emotions. Highs from the small wins and lows from the reality of no real improvements and the uncertainty of her furture. She is my first and only baby, she is my world and I love her dearly. ",1738359413.0,1ieq202

For every single nap since about 6 weeks old he will fight it (he'll be crying until he eventually falls asleep after 10 to 15 minutes of rocking). 

He's always contact napped because he won't stay asleep unless held. We have him nap either rocking in our arms or in an ergo baby carrier. 

I swear he'll stay awake if we let him. The other day we visited family for the first time in a new environment and he couldn't be soothed to nap and stayed awake for hours (even in a car ride). His eyes were red, he was cranky, and clearly tired. But wouldn't sleep. 

I follow and trial and error different wake windows but he'll barely show any sleepy cues (wake windows are about 90 minutes to 120 minutes) but he'll start crying around 80 minutes and won't stop until a nap.

beyondthebump,Motherhood changing my view of my own mom‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt comprehend my baby loving me.,"


Has anyone experienced a drastic change in how you feel about your own mom since becoming a mom yourself? 

My parents got divorced when I was around eight or nine. My dad totally abandon us and we haven‚Äôt seen him at all for 20+ years. When this happened a flip switched for me and I became a very very anxious kid. I had a hard time ever being away from my mom. I slept in my mom‚Äôs bed for a good while after all this happened as well as my grandmas if I was there. 

My mom has never really picked herself up and dusted herself off since then. Since being with my husband I feel like I‚Äôve seen things without rose coloured glasses and especially now since I have my own baby. I feel like I was neglected as a kid in a lot of ways. I was never taught to brush my teeth, we never went to the dentist. My mom never really cooked much or cleaned and we usually fended for ourselves a lot. I dont remember her ever playing with us as kids. Our rooms were crazy pig pens full of garbage and dishes. We never sat down at a table together to eat, we all ate in our bedrooms. I have felt like a mother to my own siblings for almost my entire life. My adult siblings are *still* struggling a lot with being adults and taking care of themselves. We all stayed at home much longer than socially normal because my mother never wanted us to leave her. 


She‚Äôs fallen into a terrible gambling addiction in my adulthood and threw away hundreds of thousands of dollars. She *still* blames her money troubles on divorce. 
I know that mental health problems are probably a reality but it‚Äôs hard to think of those things when she dismisses my own struggles with mental health. 

My mom is still in my life but I feel so much resentment seeing her with my own baby. She suggests things to do with the baby that make me feel my siblings and I were totally raised by the TV. Whenever she is over she instantly goes into having her watch tv‚Ä¶ If she tries to get her to fall asleep she puts on some YouTube videos and stands her really close to the tv. She runs to the baby but doesn‚Äôt acknowledge much to do with me. 

I feel like in my adulthood, since being married, I don‚Äôt feel a single ounce of comfort from my mom. When I found out I was pregnant I knew 100% I didn‚Äôt want her in the hospital room. She didn‚Äôt help me with anything afterwards, or before‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt feel comfort or love for her, now, I feel like I never actually did. I never felt safe, loved, understood and secure. 

When I look at my baby I can‚Äôt comprehend her loving me or feeling comforted by me. I feel so much love for her that it fills half of me up with hate for how I was treated by my own mom. I feel like my receptors to feeling love are broken. I feel so much love for her, I would do absolutely anything for her. I‚Äôd go without a million times before I ever let her. I just can‚Äôt feel anything in return. 

I‚Äôm so worried I‚Äôm going to mess up. I want my baby to feel so much love for me but I‚Äôm worried I don‚Äôt know how to properly. I don‚Äôt want any burden to fall on her from my past, either.

My postpartum bleeding was normal until 4 weeks when it started being on and off- it would randomly stop for a day or 2 and pick back up for a few days- back and forth until late October. Got my Mirena IUD placed October 28th and everything seemed fine at first.

I started my first post partum period November 2nd but things really took a turn for the worse. That period lasted until CHRISTMAS. When the 26th rolled around and my pad was clean I legit called it a Christmas miracle üòÇüò≠

This afternoon I cleaned the kitchen same set up but with my phone propped up with music and he was fine.

My baby is 3 months and wakes 3-4 times per night. I'm breastfeeding so I get up and feed and rock her during one of those wakings. I'm pretty tired atter getting woken up so often and never getting more than a 4 hour stretch of sleep. I was struggling to fall back asleep every time with my snoring husband, but then I kicked him out of the room to the guest bedroom.

We tried to let me get some sleep in the guest bedroom one night and only be woken for the feeding, but I couldn't sleep at all. I think mostly because I'm just not as comfortable in that bed. I also missed being next to her a little bit. 

I'm going back to work soon and my job is mentally demanding, I'm not sure how I'm supposed to function. Anyone figure this out? Can't be the only one with a snoring husband. But all the solutions in this subreddit are to kick him out of the room and do everything myself. So that kinda stinks.

beyondthebump,Cat accidentally scratched my newborns face and now I want him gone,"I have two cats who have always been my babies. Before giving birth I had never ending love and patience for them (despite one of them having serious behaviour issues due to his start in life with a past owner). I have always been an animal person and I have always had the opinion that having children isn‚Äôt an excuse for neglecting or giving up pets. 

But since giving birth 5 weeks ago I have found that my patience for my cats has completely disappeared. I don‚Äôt know if this is just hormones or if my priorities have just changed but I wish that it wasn‚Äôt this way. 

One of my cats is incredibly clingy and constantly wants my attention. He headbutts my hands and makes biscuits on my legs (he has very fast growing sharp claws so this is incredibly painful) - which has never been an issue before but now that I‚Äôm nursing my baby constantly, I find myself overstimulated and feeling touched-out. He has even tried climbing on top of my newborn to get attention from me. 

I felt that things were getting better recently for me mentally. I was able to tell myself that my animals view me as their mummy too and deserve my patience and affection even if I don‚Äôt feel like I have anything left to give. This was until about an hour ago. 

My cat (the clingy one) was sitting next to me on the couch while I was nursing, I was giving him head scratches and he seemed content just being next to me rather than trying to climb all over me. Then a noise from outside gave him a fright and he ran straight across my lap where my baby was nursing. He scratched her face up and she was crying so hard I couldn‚Äôt tell if he had scratched her eye. 

In that moment I wanted to ring his neck. I kicked him away (not super hard but regardless I‚Äôm not proud of myself but I needed him away from myself and my baby) and rushed to wash her wounds and get antiseptic cream on them. 

I‚Äôm sitting her with my baby, blood boiling and worried sick that she will get cat scratch disease due to his dirty claws. Logically, I know that this wasn‚Äôt a malicious attack. He‚Äôs not a violent cat by any stretch. But honestly I‚Äôm contemplating if I should give my pets away. I feel at a loss and heartbroken because I do love them but I love my baby more and now I don‚Äôt feel safe having her in the same room as them even if I‚Äôm present. I don‚Äôt want to give them up because I‚Äôm sure that once my post partum hormones calm down and my baby isn‚Äôt so new and fragile that I would regret the decision and miss them terribly. But I don‚Äôt know what to do in the present.. 

I‚Äôm looking for advice or even just reassurance that I‚Äôm not a terrible person for feeling this way. I feel like a bad pet owner and a bad parent. My cat is currently outside because  I can‚Äôt be around him right now and my baby is still upset because of the scratches. I‚Äôm at a loss. Has anyone else dealt with anything like this?

Then, as they get older, they could graduate from each life stage at a similar time and we won‚Äôt have to do things all over again all together.

beyondthebump,Recovery and support,"I‚Äôm a week pp and not recovering well. I luckily have amazing midwives who are making it so much better than I ever expected but I‚Äôm still struggling. I labored for 24 hours and only pushed for 3, had no tears, but right after she was born I couldn‚Äôt bond with her. I think I was in shock honestly and I had no interest in her. 


The second day I had excruciating pain and couldn‚Äôt even walk to the bathroom on my own and still had no interest in her, she also had a severe tongue tie on top of my inverted nipples and couldn‚Äôt latch without a shield, also caused excruciating pain as she was biting down to try to feed. 

They started me on toradol the third day for pain management and it was amazing, instant relief and I felt functional and could bond with her. I had 3 doses and was discharged on the fourth night but I felt great. 

The only issues I‚Äôm having are that I don‚Äôt wake up to her crying, my partner is the one who‚Äôs taking care of her majority of the time and I can see it‚Äôs taking its toll. 

All I do is sleep, pump/breastfeed, and eat. I get horrible headaches when I‚Äôm not eating. I don‚Äôt get up   due to the tailbone/lower back pain (which is 100x better than what it was but I still limp a bit), I went to l&d for the headache as well as vertigo and almost passing out and the labs are all fine. 

The midwife said I‚Äôm still recovering and I really need to move at my own pace, let my support system take care of me and baby while I get better but I really don‚Äôt like that, I feel like I‚Äôm making my partner a single mom while I just contribute milk, the lack of sleep is getting to her and she‚Äôs miserable by the morning. We‚Äôve been staying with my mom for help and my partner tried to take her for the night after my mom did 3 nights to let us sleep, by 5 am she had broken down and is scared of the fact that she‚Äôs struggling so much how are we supposed to do this if she can‚Äôt handle a single night with the baby. 

I‚Äôve only managed to wake up when she‚Äôs at her limit and even then she doesn‚Äôt get much sleep because I‚Äôll need to wake her for help here and there or to go to an appointment or something that she needs to help me with. 

I hate feeling so useless especially when I had a very ‚Äúeasy‚Äù pregnancy and delivery. I can‚Äôt just be waited on and be like a second baby to take care of, I feel like I should be up by now and waking up to the baby crying and helping out. 

Like I said all my midwives I‚Äôve seen, my mom, and my partner, they all say that I need to rest and recover and not push myself, to let them do everything else while I get better but that‚Äôs hard to do. I‚Äôm disabled and have chronic illnesses, I already needed some extra care which I always felt guilty about and now my partner is basically a single mom because I don‚Äôt do anything but eat and sleep or lie there in pain. 

I just want to help out without being a danger to myself or the baby, but last time I tried I literally almost passed out from just going to the store for a short period of time and I had to go to l&d to get checked out and then told I‚Äôm trying to push myself too hard and need to dial it back. 

No one has even complained about my lack of contribution, they all say I‚Äôm doing the most important job of feeding the baby but I don‚Äôt even wake up for that, I just sleep through it essentially while someone brings the baby to me and I will feed her half asleep or go back to sleep while someone supervises us.

beyondthebump,What would you say to my friend who is sleep deprived because of breastfeeding?,"I‚Äôm so sad for my friend who is struggling with breastfeeding. Her 3mo breastfeeds all night and she‚Äôs very tired. She has another child as well and other responsibilities. 

She doesn‚Äôt want to give formula because of social pressure coming from her MIL, doctor, friends, and even her husband!

For additional context we live in Brazil and giving formula to babies is still VERY tabu. I also suggested pumping or using a haaka but she said she‚Äôs a just enougher. 

I‚Äôve been giving formula to my own baby since she was born so I understand the social pressure. But I don‚Äôt know how to convey to her that her mental health and her sanity matters too. What would you say to her?

beyondthebump,Overfeeding EBF Baby?,"Has anyone had any experience with their EBF baby overeating?

 I'm concerned that my baby has the spirit of a Labrador Retriever, as in he never knows when he's full. He eats every time he's offered a breast and will frequently stay latched to pacify nurse for 10-20 min after eating. If he eats from both sides, I can almost guarantee a few rounds of spir-up and outfit changes are in our near future. 

We went to the lactation consultant two weeks ago and they said that they didn't see any cause for concern. And that I should carry on offering both sides every feed. But I'm losing confidence with the sheer amount of spit up that's happening. Right now we're waiting 20 minutes between sides to help things settle and our new family motto is ""don't jostle the milk baby"". However even with 20-30 min of sitting up, there's still a good chance the he spits up enough to necessitate that every one change their outfits (I'm guessing 50ml max).

beyondthebump,Breastfeeding is frustrating me (and my baby) to the point I want to scream,"Hi, all. 

I feel so sad, frustrated, and upset. My newborn is two weeks old and I‚Äôm having difficulty breastfeeding him. It‚Äôs a combination of things. After we left the hospital, we found out he has jaundice and his bilirubin levels were critical, so we were advised to pump him full of fluids every 1.5 hours. I wasn‚Äôt producing enough milk, so we had to supplement formula. 

The hospital hooked me up with a lactation consultant, but I honestly hate this woman. She shames all women who aren‚Äôt breastfeeding. One of the things that pissed me off was that my husband and I were so exhausted from three days of constant feeding, that we did whatever we could‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt have time to pump much and it was just about making my son feel better. This stupid lactation coach got extremely bitchy with me and said I wouldn‚Äôt produce enough milk with a sickly baby, so it was mandatory I pumped at least 6 times a day and that I wasn‚Äôt going to meet my goals. 

I‚Äôve been trying to do everything this dumb lady says, but with her advice, it feels like literally all I‚Äôm doing is breastfeeding or pumping all day. Baby is never satiated after breastfeeding‚Äîhe always needs a bottle with at least an ounce of formula, if not more. I pump and I‚Äôm producing maybe an ounce of milk at the very best after feeding to such a small amount it‚Äôs not even worth saving‚Äîlike a teaspoon. 

I‚Äôve watched tons of videos about the flipple technique and cross holding, which seems to be the most popular tip. I am terrible at form for most things, so I realized I might have been doing the sandwich incorrectly. 

Another issue is that my baby gets so hungry, he starts getting fussy, arching his back, and stuffing his fists into his mouth. He‚Äôs frustrated because he can‚Äôt get enough milk, and I‚Äôm frustrated because his struggling makes it really difficult to hold him in the cross cradle position and get him to latch on. Not to mention, he‚Äôs still small and has a wobbly head so I‚Äôm always worried that he‚Äôs not supported enough when I‚Äôm holding him. 

I‚Äôm at my wit‚Äôs end. There is part of me that wants to go to the lactation consultant and just tell her I‚Äôm giving up. But then I don‚Äôt want to give up on my son. It‚Äôs just I‚Äôm getting so tired of breastfeeding him for 50 minutes straight and then having him immediately stuffing his hands into his mouth and crying because he‚Äôs hungry still. It‚Äôs really destroying the bonding experience, because by the end of it, we‚Äôre both crying. 

I honestly can‚Äôt stand breastfeeding, even though I love my son and want to be able to nourish him. Any advice or tips for how to make this experience better? I feel like a huge failure and I want to breastfeed, but I also have a lot of other stress in my life and I feel like realistically I can‚Äôt keep dedicating time like this is a full-time job to breastfeed him.

I already gave Tylenol, thinking it might be pain from his second tooth coming in, and gas drops and gripe water which did nothing. Earlier today he was very squirmy as well, much more than normal, but his demeanor was good.

He has 1 bottle of formula at night with 120 ml and he finishes it with no issues or spit up. He is 5 kg and was born 4.35 kg so has always drank more than the usual guidelines.

I keep trying to breastfeed( every 3-4 hours) as he usually sleeps in between. The problem is he is taking 30 min plus at the same breast and breast is not soft.

every time i bring it up he just says ‚Äúokay‚Äù and that he‚Äôll work on it but he doesn‚Äôt. all i ask is that he holds himself to the same standards he holds me to, yet he won‚Äôt. i‚Äôm in counseling, showing progression and getting better over time. him? more focused on college and finding a new job. it consumes his life and it drives me insane. 

we just had a conversation where i expressed how frustrated i was with the situation, he said okay again, surprise! asked me what i wanted him to say and i said nothing, because nothing will change anyways. he stormed off and is playing video games. 

i hate my life. ",1738632166.0,1ih5x2h

beyondthebump,Is this weird - grandmother dictating about baby feeding,"I formula feed for medical reasons recommend to me by my medical team but no one else knows this

My first baby was formula fed with significant backlash from everyone else. My mother said several times that me and my daughter would not bond together because of this. My daughter loves her grandma very much but also loves me a whole lot too. Obviously. 

My new son is formula fed too and in the hospital some medical staff unprompted(can‚Äôt remember who maybe the feeding midwife?) said that it would be beneficial for only mum and dad to feed the baby as that would be beneficial for babies emotional regulation and bonding with the parents she said that it‚Äôs tempting for EFF to end up being pass the parcel where everyone wants to feed the baby. 

I had no problem allowing family to feed the baby but after the comments that my mother made i decided against allowing others to feed him. If I am not around and he is hungry then i obviously want him to eat. 

However it has turned into a problem where whenever I am away from baby that all of a sudden baby is constantly hungry even if she saw me feed him half an hour ago. Today she claimed that the baby had hiccups and he is hungry so we should get him some milk but I took him away to feed him myself. After she gave him a bath she proceeded to feed him even though I fed him before the bath and she was aware of this. She‚Äôs also one of those people that when the baby cries they are constantly claiming they are hungry when it could be tiredness, wind, wanting to be held etc. 

When I told her that only her parents were to feed him she said she has a closer relationship with my daughter than me which is why I‚Äôm not giving her a chance to feed her grandson

She told me to sit away from baby because she wanted to stretch her legs so I moved away and I said well you‚Äôll have to change his nappy then and then when I sat down she was like ‚Äòyou need to bring milk (after a c-section!) but I can feed him‚Äô. I told her no thanks I want to feed him myself and I did and she was obviously annoyed but I don‚Äôt care. The things she has said are hurtful and unnecessary. 

This is obviously a waste of milk and encourages cluster feeding rather than feeding every 2-4 hours which encourages baby to sleep well

beyondthebump,Participants Needed for Research Study on Intersex Youth and Families,"Gender has a strong influence on the family. Whether a child is born male or female can affect how they are raised and inform their childhood experiences. But how does caregiving differ when the child is born intersex?

We are looking for parents and caregivers of intersex individuals to take part in a research study on how families navigate gender norms.¬†

Eligibility Requirements:

* Current or former parent, guardian, or primary caregiver of an intersex child
* At least 18 years old
* Currently reside in the U.S. in Washington, Oregon, or California¬†

Selected subjects will participate in a 45 to 60 minute virtual interview and complete a short online demographic survey. Participants who are local to the Davis, CA and Yolo County area may choose to complete the interview in person. Questions may cover caregiving behaviors, individual beliefs, relationships, parent-child communications, and community resources.

This study is minimal risk. Participants may receive a maximum of $20 as compensation. There is no direct benefit from taking part in this study, but the research may identify key interventions and avenues of support for intersex youth and their caregivers.

My partner recently gave birth at Katz LIJ in Long Island (C Section).

At one point, a hospital employee rolled in a computer and started reviewing the bill and discussing payment options. We were told we had to pay around $10,000, then and there. We are first time parents and weren‚Äôt sure how to handle this, and the employee said we could receive an itemized bill after the fact to review, discuss with insurance etc.

Roughly one month later, the hospital is giving us a runaround, we can‚Äôt get a straight answer or an itemized copy of our bill. Multiple calls and emails to multiple departments. Our credit card has been charged for this ~$10k and my partner‚Äôs insurance told us the ‚Äúbirthday rule‚Äù, since my birthday comes first, will require my insurance to be used for this claim.

LO is almost 14 months old. And often takes 30-45 mins to finish eating full meals (not small snacks). This is same both at home and at daycare. He's a great eater - likes almost everything and often cleans his plate. He signs when he's finished. Teacher says they've tried asking him to hurry, focus on eating, and feed him themselves but nothing works and he won't let them feed him (heh heh). 

Now that this is coming up, I realize that I must've been a slow eater myself in grade school because I remember never having time to finish eating before I was forced to trash what food I had left and go outside (which resulted in me hiding things like fruit, tater tots, rolls in my pockets so I could finish eating on the playground).... but in this case LO is at daycare and he's just a one year old... 

I haven't really responded yet, because I don't know how. When this was first brought to my attention as an issue I was inclined to just be like ""ok? and? He's a friggin' baby, who cares? Why don't you just watch him like I pay you to?""

beyondthebump,I'm the bad guy because I won't let MIL visit the baby whenever she wants,"For context, I am a FTM with a 7 week old. Our home has been a revolving door between family and friends visiting since she was born. I'm tired. Of course, the grandparents have seen her the most, specifically my MIL. She has seen her the most out of anyone. My MIL will make some baked goods and ""drop them off"" to us aka visit the baby. I don't have a problem with my MIL coming to visit the baby. But there are days where it's just not going to work out. But she is persistent. Like today. She made a cheesecake and asks if she can drop it off. I told her I'd let her know when is a good time but I am currently nap trapped and we both barely got any sleep last night. She replies ""can I come when she's awake?"" No, you cannot. Again, I am tired. She is tired. I just want to lay on the couch and be napped trapped all day. And when she does wake up, she's going to eat, get a diaper change, I'll feed myself and then probably end back up on the couch nap trapped. Which is honestly all I want today after no sleep last night and a very busy weekend. I don't want to put on a bra and handle my dogs so someone can come in my home. My baby is chilling, I am chilling, my dogs are chilling. We are all just chilling today. I'm just not up for it right now. Shouldn't that be enough? 

So I was venting to a childless friend of mine about this and she says to me that she understands where I'm coming from but this is my MIL's first grandchild and she's just excited and wants to see her. The amount of times I have heard this from several other people since having my baby is insane. Isn't she my first child? Do people forget that? My MIL already had 2 kids. She isn't the one sleep deprived, stressed out, recovering from a c-section, and taking care of her 24/7, so why do her feelings and wants come before mine when it comes to seeing my baby? I'm so sick of people villainizing me when it comes to not allowing my MIL over whenever she wants. And the problem with my MIL is she doesn't take no for an answer. I tell her not today and she says it'll only be 5-10 minutes. I don't care how long you're here for. I don't want anyone here right now. It should just be that. I shouldn't have to explain myself to anyone, let along, be made out to be the bad guy because it's her first grandchild. When I first gave birth, it was an unplanned c-section. I was naked, in pain, on the verge of passing out and puking for 2 days after. I received a text from my MIL's SIL telling us we need to let her in the hospital to see the baby because she's the grandmother and this is her first grandchild. All of this occurred even when I had made it extremely clear my whole pregnancy we were not having visitors in the hospital. Then my MIL calls us while we are still in the hospital to say she only needs 15 minutes with her. I'm sorry, but you don't need anything. Where does it end? 

It's honestly so invalidating as a FTM that's exhausted and trying balance everyone getting a chance to see my baby frequently but also keep myself sane. No one is deprived of seeing my child. Imo, my husband and I do a good job at allowing people to visit often.

People need to stop making moms out to be the bad guy when we say no to the grandparents or anyone for that matter coming for a visit. 

Signed,

beyondthebump,Does anyone regret having the unplanned child (especially due to financial reasons)?,"I (F29) am about 4 weeks into my unplanned pregnancy and I contemplate terminating it due to financial reasons.

I've been with my amazing partner (M28) for over 3 years now and while we both want kids, this baby is going to be 2 years earlier than expected. We are nowhere near we would like to be financially: we had just depleted our savings to purchase a condo end of last year; I'm currently making a lot more than my partner, meaning we will be in a disastrous financial position when I go on mat leave (For context, I live in Toronto, Canada and the EI payment of 600/wk can't cover our mortgage, less alone any other expenses). My partner is in trades, so he is set to get a significant pay increase in the next 2 years, and we would have replenished our savings by then. I have always been frugal and responsible, so the thought of being financially insecure is very scary to me. We are not on speaking terms with my partners parents, and my parents are out of the country (I'm a first gen immigrant) so we don't really have a support system here but ourselves. I'm also a late bloomer; I worked my ass off putting myself through college and only got to enjoy life a bit more for the past 3-4 years after starting my ""adult"" job so even though it sounds selfish, I really wanted to live my life this year and start trying early next year.

I have no doubt my partner will be an amazing, supportive parent and if we decide to keep the baby, we'll somehow push through, but I still cannot make peace with the uncertainty it's bringing. I grew up poor in a third world country and didn't feel missing out, but doesn't mean I would want the same for my child. The guilt is eating me up because my close friends are either on medications trying to conceive, or having to terminate her planned and wanted pregnancy, while I'm here contemplating a (probably) healthy one. I feel like I'm not appreciative of the unexpected gift I'm receiving.

Those who have had an unwanted pregnancy in a not-so-ideal financial situation, did you keep the baby? Did you regret it?

I texted him tonight a photo of our son and said he‚Äôs doing okay and asked if he wanted to see him tomorrow and he hasn‚Äôt even replied. I am heartbroken by this. He hasn‚Äôt even asked how me or his son are since we‚Äôve been gone. 

I can‚Äôt believe I have ended up having a baby with a man who‚Äôs turning out to be just like my own father. I hate myself and blame myself entirely for this messed up situation.

beyondthebump,A little bit of everything rolled into one post,"I guess this post is a little bit of everything (intro, birth story, mental health). 

I gave birth on Jan 28 to a health baby boy who weighed 4208 grams and measured 53 cm.

He arrived into the world with some reluctance, as I was induced at 11:00 on Monday morning. By 19:20, I was comfortably settled in bed at home, watching old episodes of quiz shows, when my water broke. Since the baby was not engaged, i had to call an ambulance. So that‚Äôs what I did and I was taken the hospital, where I was put on bed rest and wasn‚Äôt allowed to get up until midday the next day, as he was still very high up.

By midday Tuesday, he had moved down a little but was still not engaged, so the waiting game began. Both he needed to engage, and my cervix needed to dilate‚Äîneither of which was happening easily.

After more than 24 hours of pills and IV drips, his heart rate started slowing down after each contraction (though it quickly recovered), so the decision was made to rush me in for a C-section. The procedure was quick and went incredibly well!

I‚Äôm now six days postpartum and physically I feel absolutely fine. I stayed at the hospital until last Friday and then went home. Breastfeeding has been difficult since I have edema in my nipples making them thick and hard but it seems to be correcting itself. 

The thing is that I now have a six day old, he‚Äôs my first child and it took a lot for him to get here (he‚Äôs an IVF baby). I didn‚Äôt really know what to expect when he got here but what I didn‚Äôt expect is the overwhelming power of love I have for him. I have never experienced this before, and I routinely cry just looking at him because the emotions are just too much for me to handle. 

I‚Äôm crying as I write this. We‚Äôre laying in bed together, he‚Äôs just sleeping and I‚Äôm weeping by his side cause he‚Äôs so precious and little and perfect and beautiful and I can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs here and that it‚Äôs my job to keep him safe and love him until the end. 

I feel so lucky, but I‚Äôm also getting a bit worried about the amount of times I cry out of nowhere. I‚Äôve talked about this with my midwife, I have actively been trying to get into therapy since October through the health service here because I do have an anxiety disorder and have been afraid of PPD so wanted to get the ball rolling but they forgot to put me on the official list so I was never called in. They told me there was a waiting list til at least December and I trusted that was the reason I never got a call but apparently they just forgot about me. But I also know that baby blues is a thing and that this may be that. 

I just get so emotional when I look at his perfect little cheeks. ",1738603767.0,1iguky1
beyondthebump,Numbness from c-section months later - Does that mean I'm still not fully healed?,"Hi,

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but here it goes: I had an emergency c-section in April 2024. My recovery was very easy and straightforward, no issues at all. The pregnancy was also easy. Here's the thing though: I want to try to get pregnant again around October of this year (making it 18 months between the birth of my first baby, and getting pregnant again). Reason for 'the rush' is I'm in my late thirties and don't have the luxury to wait forever, and I would like my kids close in age. I've mentioned that to my OB at my 6 weeks postpartum check up and she said that 18 months is absolutely fine.

Anyways, I'm almost 10months pp now, and the area around my scar is still numb. Maybe it has gotten a little less numb over the past couple of months, I'm not sure, but it definitely still is numb. I'm not sure if that means my incision isn't healing properly? Like, if I'm still numb in a few months, does that mean I should not start trying to get pregnant again, since it doesn't seem to have fully healed yet? Also, I was wondering if I should make an appointment with my OBGYN before getting pregnant again, so they can check the incision, and get a full check up to see if my body is ready for baby #2? Or is that not something that's necessary unless you have health problems? 

Thank you.",1738603406.0,1igufg7

beyondthebump,Hospital choice,"Torn over which hospital to deliver baby #2. 

Baby #1 was 9.5lb vaginal birth at a small hospital. It went well, kinda despite the birthing team. The nurses looked hung out to dry. I was pressured to get an epidural very early for vauge reasons like ‚Äúthe anesthesiologist might not answer our call later‚Äù, whoever was placing my urinanry catheter effed up and I was in excruciating pain, the epidural traveled upwards and I couldn‚Äôt breathe because my lungs weren‚Äôt contracting properly which I was told for over an hour was ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù until the nursing staff finally rotated and one of them listened to me, tested my chest and neck for numbness, and got help, the nurses were very distracted and bored while I was pushing, and nobody told me what was happening while they were stitching me up and pulling out the placenta. Just kinda amateur hour. Nothing went wrong but we left with the feeling like they weren‚Äôt equipped to handle things if shit really hit the fan. Also, Baby 1 was healthy as a horse, but there is no NICU here so airlifting to the next state over is the default if there is an issue, and mom and baby travel separately.


I‚Äôd like to do another vaginal birth but was surprised that they‚Äôve pressured me to schedule a c-section 3 times now (my ob and hospital are across the street and share staff). I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôre going to jump to pressure me to c-section when I give birth because they knew my first baby was so big (even though I only pushed for maybe 1.5 hours, which I understand to be normal). An emergency c-section is never ideal but friends who have had that at the local hospital are literally traumatized by their experience. 

We have a great hospital about 2 hours from us. I‚Äôve had friends deliver on the side of the highway trying to get there, but I had about 24 hours of labor before going to the hospital with baby 1, and another 24 hours laboring in the hospital so odds are I could probably make it. However, friends and family will be some distance away so we‚Äôll be a good ways from our daughter, pets, and general support system which was awesome to have once the baby was here last time.

Any opinions? Are the things that went wrong in my first birth just as likely to happen anywhere else or should I be taking them more seriously?",1738600061.0,1igt1rc
beyondthebump,Never thought I would love breastfeeding so much.  It‚Äôs literally addicting.,"The hormones are insane. Since day one even when I had PPD, whenever I nursed my daughter I‚Äôd feel so euphoric. It‚Äôs so intimate and special. For the past few weeks she often briefly unlatches to make eye contact with me and gives me the biggest grin that radiates across her whole face before continuing. The twinkle in her eye is indescribable. I try to show my husband whenever that happens. But I don‚Äôt think he can fully get it. It pierces my soul and makes me feel like my heart is going to burst with joy. 

Ignoring the practical aspects, a part of me wishes I could breastfeed forever. I know that‚Äôs impossible. Of course my daughter won‚Äôt be so little for long and won‚Äôt need me as much. Of course she needs to develop healthy independence soon enough. But for now I cherish every moment. Every gulp. Every time she kneads my boob with her tiny hand. Every finger grab. Every chance to stroke her soft chubby cheeks and wispy hair. I always thought I would hate breastfeeding and only started because I was supposed to. Turns out it has been my favorite part of motherhood so far. 

NOTE: This is in no way meant to shame parents who cannot or do not want to breastfeed. Any time spent caring for and feeding your babies formula shows the same amount of love. I also don‚Äôt want to pretend my journey was easy. My daughter didn‚Äôt latch in the beginning and I was exclusively pumping for weeks. Sometimes my nipples have hurt so bad that I‚Äôm speechless and hunched over in pain. I‚Äôve also been so engorged that I start sweating from the pain. I wish I didn‚Äôt have to worry about the logistics of whipping my tits out in public and whether it would make things awkward. And I also sometimes wish she would drink more types of formula easier so she wouldn‚Äôt be as reliant on me. As parents we all have it hard in different ways and we are judged by society enough already. So please know this is not a jab at anyone. ",1738598531.0,1igsfd4

My LO just turned 8 months old and has been dealing with a lot of separation anxiety from me (mom, primary caregiver).
From everything I‚Äôve read separation anxiety and stranger danger are big and normal at this age but the people around me are making it seem like this is somehow my fault and something I need to ‚Äúfix‚Äù. üôÑ

My husband and I left LO with my mom last night while we grabbed dinner solo for the first time in months and my poor kiddo cried the entire 2-3 hours we were gone. 

He‚Äôs teething, learning to crawl and babble, and getting over a sleep regression so he‚Äôs got alot going on developmentally so none of this is surprising to me but when we picked him up my mom and stepdad basically told me it was a nightmare and ‚Äúyou‚Äôve goes fix that‚Äù, ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt let him act like that‚Äù, etc‚Ä¶ 

I should mention I did tell them he doesn‚Äôt like to be away from me, even in the same house with his own dad and to call us if they needed up to come get him early. They chose not to so the complaining was even more frustrating to me. I would have much preferred to pick him up then let him cry that long as well.

For background, I work part time from home. My mother in law comes over everyday I work to watch him for us.

I went to the sleep train sub and got some amazing advice which worked super well. I wanted to share the changes I implemented in case it might help someone else. 

1 - we implemented at 2/2.5/2.5/3 schedule and officially dropped to 3 naps per day. 

2 - set a consistent time wake up time. 

3 - I cap total daytime sleep at about 2.5 hours (I have a lower sleep needs baby)

4 - we transitioned baby out of the bassinet in our room and to his own room/crib. 

5 - We completely unswaddle him (he was still sleeping with 1 arm swaddled in. 

6 - If we heard him fussing on the monitor, we don‚Äôt run to him right away. He will often put himself back to sleep. 

Baby is not ST yet and still initially feeds to sleep. 

However with these changes, baby went from doing short night (like 9 hours total) and waking up 2-3 or more times. To sleeping 10 hours with only 1 feed! The first stretch is usually 8 hours when it used to be like 4-5 hours. It‚Äôs amazing.

beyondthebump,Double standards and hypocrisy!!,"
I just need to vent and see if anyone else has gone through this!

Ever since my first LO was born, I had to deal with my MIL and SIL constantly telling me what I should and shouldn't do with my baby. From breastfeeding to pacifiers to bottles-you name it‚ÄîI was bombarded with a never-ending list of rules based on what ""health experts"" supposedly recommend.

What made it worse was the way they positioned themselves as more qualified than me just because my SIL had a baby first and both she and my MIL work in healthcare.
But here's what really infuriated me: even if I wanted to push back and remind them that I am the parent, they wouldn't just stop at telling me. No, they would go straight to my DH, feeding him their ""advice"" until he started telling me what I should or shouldn't be doing. And because he's the other parent, it made it much harder for me to stand my ground without it turning into a battle.

Fast forward to now-l've had my second baby, and I've decided I truly do not care what anyone else has to say. This time around, I'm doing things my way because:
1. My SIL has struggled with her multiple kids, so she's in no position to act like an expert.
2. My husband finally understands that I know what's best for OUR children.
3. I keep my MIL at more of a distance to maintal. my sanity.

But here's where my blood really boils: after all that unsolicited advice, all the judgment, all the arguments with my DH-these same women have now completely abandoned their own ""rules."" My SIL just had another baby and had the nerve to tell me how bottle feeding has made her life sooo much easier after she and my MIL swore up and down that bottles cause nipple confusion. Meanwhile, my first baby never took a bottle because of them, and it was a huge struggle for me.

TL;DR: My MIL and SIL spent years telling me what was ""best"" for MY child, only to turn around and ignore their own so-called rules when it suited them.

They‚Äôve spent so much time on screens these last few months, and I am so grumpy all the time.

I don‚Äôt know if having the baby here will make it better because I won‚Äôt be pregnant and in constant pain, or if it will be worse because postpartum has always been rough for me. Their dad is here, but not always the most attentive, he generally has a temper and I am softer with the kids but again lately it‚Äôs just been chaos. I don‚Äôt have a ton of support from him. The last two pregnancies he was helpful but I was also younger and didn‚Äôt need as much help. This time around I need more help AND he‚Äôs less attentive. I sleep on the living room couch because the bed isn‚Äôt comfortable for me, but since I started sleeping separately he just lays on the bed in the room all day watching tv, it‚Äôs turned into his room and I‚Äôm just always alone.

1 month old baby gets totally FUCKED when I give her a bottle of formula or pumped milk (up to 120ml in one feed, or I think 4 American Oz) 

It's as if she just injected heroin. It's easy enough to make her sleep after that.

When she drinks milk from boobies, she doesn't seem as ""stoned"" and it's much much harder to get her to sleep. She's just very fussy and never looks or even feels very full.

Since she's mostly breastfed, it means she's mostly awake and fussy and never seems full.

What's the problem? Is the baby supposed to get ""stoned"" from breastfeeding? Or is it only formula that does this? Or are the bottles too big?

Could it be a problem with mother's milk supply or ""flow rate""? Too slow, or not enough?

He is now 16 weeks and still no improvement‚Ä¶ he has CMPA and is formula fed, anecdotally his problems started around 3 weeks after the first dose of Rotarix-vaccine. Dyschezia isn‚Äôt really talked about in my country so my ped first thought it was constipation and prescribed laxatives.  He would strain and strain, for days, to no avail. When I couldn‚Äôt take seeing him suffer I used a windii and out came all the poop (which was watery from laxatives). I told ped I didn‚Äôt think it was constipation and stopped using laxatives, as he could go 6 days without popping and it was still soft. He still can only go about every 4 days, and only with help from some kind of stimulation (I wipe his bum with wet wipe and he goes after a while). 

However, after learning about dyschezia some say you shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúhelp‚Äù them with stimuli??? Have I been hurting him when I thought I was helping? I mean by day 5-6 of no popping being formula fed he is UNHAPPY and I feel like I have to step in.

beyondthebump,How did motherhood change your relationship to your mom?,"I want to hear your stories!

I've heard a lot of positive stories and I feel a bit like an odd one out for thinking less of my mum's parental achievements? I'm curious if that's something common or not.

I always thought my mom went through so much struggle with me but now hearing her stories I can only think that she had it much much easier than I do now with my LO. And, mind you, I don't struggle! My LO is a chill baby and we had very few issues. She just apparently had a lot served on a silver platter without ever realizing it. It doesn't help that she still behaves like she's so good with kids when she hasn't even held a baby for 20+ years and only ever had one very chill, village-raised baby.

I genuinely can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm in the wrong here though. My MIL constantly tells husband and I that we have to go on more date nights so that she and her husband can babysit our 16-month-old daughter. 

It‚Äôs not my husband‚Äôs biological father‚Äîit‚Äôs his ‚Äústepdad‚Äù that his mother has been with for a few years. There‚Äôs something about him that makes alarm bells go off in my head. I won‚Äôt go into much detail, but one example is that none of his 5 adult kids speak to him.

I‚Äôm VERY protective of my baby girl, and I know that almost all childhood SA happens in the family. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever let her babysit our daughter when her husband is around. She has babysat daughter a few times when I know her husband is working.

Obviously I also cannot tell her that the reason I don‚Äôt let her babysit very much is because of her husband; therefore, it‚Äôs awkward since she keeps pushing it.

My bruising post op was horrific. And at 2 weeks PP I ended up in the ER because it was starting to open up and bleed. Turned out I had a hematoma growing the whole time and they had to irrigate it, squeeze out the blood clots AGAIN, and I left with a wound vac. Once the wound vac was removed a week later, it was finally starting to heal up. I'm returning back to work in just a few days and a little concerned about the physical demands of my job because even now at 10 weeks PP it is still sensitive. The other day I helped my husband move some couches and I felt a bit sore after that. Plus I still have 1 super tiny spot that looks a little strange.

beyondthebump,Feels like my postpartum body is breaking down,"I‚Äôm 26f and 5 months pp. I‚Äôve been having fairly intense body aches and pains since giving birth that have only continued to increase in severity as time passes. None of the other moms in my life whom I have spoke to about this have experienced it. 

While I was pregnant, I assumed that my back, hip, and foot pain would largely disappear after having my baby. Such has not been the case. 

I have pretty severe back pain. It is the worst when I am laying down, and in certain positions is honestly excruciating - like take your breath away level. It is typically concentrated in my lower back, but not exclusive to. I did have lower back pain while I was pregnant, but not like this. 

My hips hurt so bad. When I stand up from sitting, it takes a few seconds for me to warm up and get to walking normally. If I‚Äôve been sitting for a while, I have to move very slowly at first and wince as I get up and begin walking, which is honestly more akin to a shuffle/waddle. I did have hip pain while pregnant, and it was at its worst the last 3 weeks of my pregnancy. It is not as bad now as it was those last 3 weeks, but it‚Äôs still making my life harder and is worse than it was the majority of my pregnancy. 

While my back and hips are the worst of it, my shoulders, neck, wrists, ankles, knees, and feet hurt as well. I feel like I went having the body of a 25 year old to having the body of a 55 year old in the span of a year. I would consider myself to have a decently high pain tolerance as well, for ex: I handled pitocin induced labor without pain medicine very well, was still able to walk and talk and my nurses were impressed. 

What‚Äôs really interesting to me is that my PP body pains have increased since I had my baby. I thought they would improve over time, but they only continue to worsen. Yesterday I was sitting in a slightly odd position and heard my back make this sickening crunching noise. It hurt, and alarmed me. I feel like my body is breaking down and falling apart. Is this normal? Has anyone else experienced this? Could it be due to losing nutrients via breastfeeding? Damaged pelvic floor? A degenerative condition triggered by pregnancy?

beyondthebump,Baby sleep - husband wakes me up,"My almost 4 month old sleeps really well, 7pm to 6am with only one night waking.

My husband is a really great dad and helps with all the feedings when he is around. I pump and he bottle feeds at the night waking (I'm exclusively pumping). I'm still on maternity leave. He is working, but it's slow in January so is mostly home except 1-3 days a week. 

My husband likes to stay up late. This was fine when we did a dream feed as I'd sleep and he'd stay up to do the dream feed. Sometimes I'd get up at this time to pump and sometimes I'd stay asleep.

Dream feeds stopped working, and our baby gets up at 1 to 4am for the one night feeding no matter what. So now I get woken up when he comes to bed after me, And again for the night feed when I need to pump. 

This wouldn't be too bad but lately because my husband doesn't prioritize his own sleep and he drinks before bed he's been waking me up after the night feed either sleep walking to pick up the baby or searching the bed for the baby (we don't co sleep - he is always in his bassinet). 

So I get woken  up every two hours by my husband even when my baby is sleeping. It happened twice last night! Most of the time I get so worked up after this I can't fall back asleep. I'm on high alert because I don't want him sleep walking with the baby. 

I asked him to come to bed at the same time or at least not after 10pm so he gets enough sleep, and I've asked him to drink less. Ive asked him several times and he won't do it. He said he wouldn't drink as much once I was pregnant (didn't happen) and then once the baby is here (also hasn't happened).

Without fail if he stays up too late and also drinks he sleeps walks or searches the bed for the baby, waking me up. 

Then he feels bad when I get upset about being woken up and pouts all day / is hard on himself. And that makes me feel depressed, like I'm asking too much on top of being sleep deprived. I already have PPD on top of this (in treatment).

I'm at my wits end, it's been 4 months of this. I sacrifice so much, including any free time so I can go to bed early and get sleep. But it's all for nothing because my husband thinks he needs to watch TV for hours at night alone and drink instead of taking his own sleep seriously (and my sleep, and honestly also our son's safety seriously!).

beyondthebump,Husband sleeps majority of the time he is at home and I have 2 young children. Need advice on what to do?,"I've been with my husband several years before I had children. Being a introvert I was okay with him working, sleeping - rinse and repeat. I remember him always passing out if I needed a shoulder to lean on, I even remember him sleeping after the wedding at 2pm and not wanting to leaving the house. 

I saved money, so when I gave birth to my oldest child my husband was living on the savings and did not need to work for 6 months, I remember he still fell asleep for majority of the day. 

He told me to go sleep when I was in labour with my first child. 
He was sleeping when I gave birth to my second. He was sleeping when I was in hospital with a hemorrhage after giving birth. 

After having my second child this sleep situation got worse. He works early breakfast shifts. So comes back home around 4pm. Problem is he starts to fall asleep out around 5pm. 

I haven't had proper sleep since 4 years. I breastfeed at night and had hyperemesis. My first child had colic. So I've calculated I must only get 4 hours of sleep maximum sometimes it's like 1 hour. I have to do all the DIY, cook, clean, change nappies, take children out, manage the money, create shopping lists, washing, ironing, basically everything in the home and to do with children is done by me. My husband struggles to even stand up by the time he comes home. I even have to organise my husband's clothes, grooming him, making him breakfast etc he's like a older child who works.

I need his help I have no one else. I'm starting to resent him.

His mum told him not to do anything at home and go to sleep , and I should carry on the routine like how I do during the day and why I need help at night. It really feels like he is listening to this advice. 

This situation is getting me down, I'm becoming very slow at the routine. I feel like I am struggling to be a good mother. I could be better, happier more energetic with the children. But I am completely on my own. 

I even research for his condition, try to finish routine early as possible. He sleeps in his own room so his sleep is uninterrupted. I give him vitamin d. I asked him if he is depressed he says it's his early shifts. 

Yesterday he admitted to me he finds being a husband to tiring and a father. But he doesn't want to abandon the children or me. 

I need to do just forget he exists and continue my routine. I can't leave him he won't allow a divorce and if I force it I'll loose my house and possibly my children. 

How can I help him and myself?

Sorry for rant. 

The doctor said his vitamin d was slightly low, so I've been giving him vitamin d and more salmon but he seems to still fall asleep. It's very strange but I remember giving him some sushi and he seemed to stay awake how normal people are for 3 days then went back to usual again. ",1738509350.0,1ifzcmc

beyondthebump,Terrified of becoming a single mom,"I am so broken and lost. I‚Äôm a FTM to a beautiful perfect 4 month old baby girl and my husband and I are on the verge of divorce. My husband was truly the most incredible man before I got pregnant (and yes we were trying/planning). For some reason, when I got pregnant he panicked and started treating me differently. Things really took a turn for the worse postpartum though. He threw his back out during my labor so I was basically on my own. I had a traumatic induction that lasted from Friday-Monday night and involved excessive bleeding, vomiting and insane pain I‚Äôll never forget from the interventions they tried to get me to dilate. The worst night I was alone, as he‚Äôd gone home to sleep. Postpartum I was on my own too as this back issue lasted months. He couldn‚Äôt move well or hold her so I did everything from the minute I gave birth. It‚Äôs now 4 months later and although he recovered around the 2 month mark, he has never done an overnight or lost a minute of sleep. He hardly helps and takes care of himself first. He showers when he wants, eats when he wants, goes where he wants when he wants and hardly checks in if I need help. I‚Äôve struggled with extreme sleep deprivation and depression and it‚Äôs like he doesn‚Äôt care. The only thing he cares about is how he isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgetting anything‚Äù so what‚Äôs the point (meaning sex). I tore second degree in 2 places and aside from that am exhausted, sex is the last thing on my mind. Not to mention I‚Äôm resentful of doing everything by myself (laundry, dishes, baby dishes, naps, bedtime, baths, etc). He would take naps on the weekend without even asking if he should take the baby. Last night I was up all night (4 months sleep regression is killing me) and he didn‚Äôt check on us once. He slept in until nearly noon‚Ä¶ I have to give credit that he does try for spurts but it‚Äôs so short lived and he reverts back to being selfish and distant. 

He doesn‚Äôt understand the toll that pregnancy took on me and postpartum. He doesn‚Äôt get being touched out and exhausted. He doesn‚Äôt get why I don‚Äôt feel overly affectionate or ready for sex (despite explaining it 100 times). We bicker all the time. I feel drained and defeated. Talking to him is like talking to a teenager that mocks me and only cares about ‚Äúme me me‚Äù. 

I never thought about the possibility of becoming a single mom and I‚Äôm terrified. I‚Äôm scared for what it‚Äôll do to my daughter and feel like I‚Äôve failed her. I‚Äôm terrified to be on my own.

So if I‚Äôm doing combo feeding, and my newborn is falling asleep between breasts and bottle. When exactly do I start the next feed if they fall asleep at the breast or bottle before finishing?

I am feeding on demand if they signal before the 2 hr mark. 

Newborn will fall asleep for anywhere between five minutes to 2 hours between breasts and bottle. Sometimes they will feed from all three without falling asleep between.

I had invited her over for the 2:00 feed at 1pm so I could pump she also lives 3 miles or so down The street retired and sits on ass all day, mind you. I heard no response from her so I figured she'd show up or not. I got a call at 1:30 it was my mother she said she was passing by and asked of she could stop in I said sure then I told her his mom was supposed to be over here for dinner to celebrate his birthday just to tell her basically she can only stop is for a little. MIL arrived at 1:44pm i opened the door for her. I don't remember what me and my own mother were doing on the couch but we were talking about a boucher for a nurse  that comes to visit you to check on you and baby and see if you need help with development stuff or health stuff. MIL walked in and decided she'd just go sit in the kitchen chair at the table in the other room and she seem to have been irritated when she walked in. I moved pillows that were in the way on our  3 seater plus lounger couch and I told her she could come sit over on the couch. She came over and sat in silence staring off. I walked away to make a bottle and other things my mother made conversation and asked about her kids birth sizes and stuff. My mother went to go change my babies diaper and I followed her to go change it so I could talk to her. I heard my MIL grab her keys and walk out the door. I was telling  my mother that I wanted her to give my MIL a tutorial on how to feed the baby because I was uncomfortable teaching. Then I suspected how her demeanor was while she was here that she had left. I looked out the window and saw she drove away. I was just so irritated I called her and she didn't answer. She text me later and said
 ""sorry i didn't mean to intrude on your time with you mom, I don't answer the phone while I'm driving ü§ó"" which I believe I call BS I'm sure I've heard her answer before while driving. I explained the situation  to her and she didn't message back. I called my husband so he wouldn't get mad at me if she's wasn't there when he got home. He told me that she better be there for his birthday or else he will not he happy after I explained the situation in short to him. He also said having two grandma's there is not good as that baby can't be cut in half and shared so I brought that storm issue myself after I told my mom yes for her to pop in. 

I  messaged her and asked if she was one her way back she said ""no, why, I'm not, why?"" ""Because your son is expecting to see your for his birthday"". She responded with ""i left his present and cake. I'll see him another time, it's ok.""  I said in response to that ""I guess I don't know what the issue is ? 
Your son is EXPECTING you to be here ON his birthday!"" She say There is no issue, (my name)...you said come, i came ...you and were busy, and talking ,so i left...drop off his birthday stuff..."" I said again ""I was busy putting a bottle together and talking about brochures that has in home nurse help that doesn't cost anything and the organizations that runs it. ""  she responded with 
""And thats ok, like I said you and mom were talking, and felt out of place....so i left thats all no issue. That stuff is more important, "" 

So I chose not to respond after that because I just wanted to smack a bitch. Husband came home he had called her to tell her to come back over and she still refused. I saw him and I was concerned as he doesn't want my mother  here just yet when he gets off work so I told her he was home and she tried to leave and he walked in  she apologized and he said he wasn't mad at her and I ran away to the other room because I knew who he was mad at ""me"".  This isn't the only time this woman has pulled this stunt she did this when we moved i to our house i got mad at my husband because he hadn't told me he was having  her over to help organize the house and I hadn't bought enough frozen meal to feed her as well and he should've told me so I would've bought more and I was going to run to the store and that bitch decided that she was to blame and ran off and my husband left me, went to her house and spent the rest of the time with her and had dinner and wasn't even there to help organize the house or chose what goes where. I didn't even want to tell my mom and sisters where to put what because that son of a bitch (literally) tore that experience away and i didn't know how to handle this sole decision as it was a joint one. 

I am literally banning her from coming over her just to help me out during the day I may suffer but that happening a second time and it causing a rift now in me and my husband's relationship because her silly childish stunt. Ahhh!

My husband told her in the phone today that she needed to apologize to me. I over heard this and was not interested in her apologize. She later came over today and I knew i was going to hear one, it wasn't genuine or sincere to me and it just sounded like a phony forced apology. She explained  her side and so did I and I told her ""well you thought wrong"" what I should've said this wasn't the first time you've done this!

It's been a roller coaster of year. Most recently she had RSV and ended up with some kind of secondary I fection which ended up with her on cefdinir because of an amoxicillin allergy. Cefdinir ALWAYS ends up with her having a BAD diaper rash no matter how hard we try to beat the curve and be pre-emptive. I'm talking bleeding, raw kind of diaper rash. This time was no exception

Things we've done in the past that have helped: breastmilk baths (all frozen/expired at this point so only good for baths), baking soda baths (GOATed honestly, it works so well), athlete's foot cream (clotrimazole, works so good), and then your usual aquaphor/desitin diaper creams.

This time around, we tried the breast milk bath and it didn't really work, the next night we did a baking soda bath and the next day her diaper rash looked SO much better and she was in better spirits too. It was still raw and angry the next night so we did another one. Cut to this morning, the morning after the second baking soda bath, and I got to change her morning diaper and she has a blotchy rash all over her body minus her face. Give her some benadryl and it goes away within the hour. Cut to bath time and I make sure husband gives the tub a good rinse before we put her in to make sure the baking soda and breast milk are all cleared out, 10 minutes later her legs are breaking out.

Has anyone heard of a baking soda allergy? Could it just be irritating to her skin? I'm just not sure here",1738457371.0,1ifl5tj
beyondthebump,7 month old hates the carrier,"I've been putting my baby in carriers since she was a newborn with no issues. I used a fabric wrap when she was smaller and she would always nap in it. Around 2-3 months I started using a more structured carrier, I have the Mabe one. But as soon as she got older and awake more often she's so unhappy in the carrier if she's not sleepy. I think it's because she's a baby that really likes to move around a lot, but she also wants to be held all the time (she loves being held on my hip because she can still hold toys, look and move around, etc). So I try to put her in the carrier to get things done but she hates it. I've tried back carrying but I think her arms are more restricted that way so she doesn't like that either. It could just be the fit of the carrier that I have, because she still can't comfortably have her arms over the top of it. But carriers are also expensive and I can't constantly be buying them to try different ones out.",1738457182.0,1ifl3n0

beyondthebump,Thoughts on a nanny who has her own baby‚Ä¶?,"Hello parents. Need some advice from you wise people. I am a FTM, so I second guess myself a lot and I‚Äôd love to hear from experienced people. 

My baby is 16 weeks old and I‚Äôll be starting back to work March 3. Currently, my neighbor (who has a 5 month old baby) and I are looking for a nanny to share. In our city, nanny prices run usually $16-$18 an hour per child for a nanny share or $25-28 an hour for single family. The way our schedules work out, I am full time, using the nanny for 40 hours a week and she is part time, using the nanny for 20 hours a week. The share will happen at my house. 

We just interviewed a nanny that my neighbor loves and wants to move forward with. The catch is, she will have her 10 month old daughter with her, as well. My neighbor likes her because of her experience but also because she is ‚Äúonly‚Äù changing $15/ hr for share and $22 an hour for single family.

My thinking is that this price is still too high. Her daughter, being older than ours, will need more supervision. I also think someone is just naturally inclined to to pay more attention to their own child‚Äôs needs. But beyond that it seems like she is charging too much? I‚Äôd be paying $22 an hour for a good portion of the week even though she will be watching both of our children, which is higher than I would pay any other nanny to watch two children. In addition, there will be three babies running around my house versus just two which seems like a lot. I would expect a big savings to essentially have a daycare in my house. I have also looked at daycare where the ratio of teacher teachers to babies is 3 to 1 and the cost essentially works out to $12.75 an hour. 

Am I thinking about this wrong? Does her price seem reasonable? My neighbor really wants to move forward with her and while she hasn‚Äôt outright said so, I feel like she thinks I‚Äôm being too picky. 

Im not going to get walked over. I am comfortable saying no, but I just wanted some other perspectives. ",1738440657.0,1iff544

beyondthebump,Nurse made me feel like I failed for needing an emergency c section,"I really didn't think I'd have a c section. My mom had many children naturally and I had a completely uncomplicated pregnancy. I ended up having a 10 lb baby and failed to progress. I was taking too long to push and both mine and the babys heart rates weren't looking good so had to have an emergency c section.

While recovering and processing my birth trauma a nurse came in to check my blood and here's how the conversation went:

Nurse: ""emergency c section hey?""

Me: ""yeah baby was pretty big and I got induced  so I guess it's sort of expected""

Nurse: ""well my friend naturally birthed a 13 pound baby so it's more so because you don't have child bearing hips...my friend had child bearing hips""

Me: laughs nervously 

Nurse: ""you know that's why it's so attractive to guys and they rave and make songs about child bearing hips...because naturally guys are attracted to girls who can birth their babies""

At this point I checked out and stopped talking. She left the room and I cried. 

To make things worse I told my MIL about this story and she was like ""that really sucks and even though she is right about child bearing hips being a thing I can see how that comment would hurt .

My son is coming up on two. He‚Äôs a happy, chilled little man who‚Äôs always slept well and loves a cuddle.

I‚Äôm just getting a bit anxious that his interests aren‚Äôt very varied. What he loves is sitting on a lap and having a story read to him. He‚Äôs got a great vocab as a result.  He also loves music and can ask for most tracks by either the right name or name we understand. He can identify most songs he knows by the intro.

But he‚Äôs reluctant to engage in other ways. Not really interested in drawing at all. Likes holding trains and cars but not really into making tracks. Doesn‚Äôt want to play with blocks. Despite loving music he doesn‚Äôt really dance. He‚Äôs just not very independently minded. Lots of his peers are insisting on dressing themselves but he‚Äôs not fussed. Very happy to be dressed. 

I‚Äôm aware he‚Äôll have his two year review soon and a lot of questions are about can he do X or can he do Y. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll be able to answer them as I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs interested enough to try most of them.

beyondthebump,"FTM, stressful postpartum period, looking for support and comfort--will things get better?","Hi all, it's almost 7 AM here and I've been awake for a couple of hours, just unable to sleep. Our daughter arrived a little over 6 weeks ago, and it feels like it's been a nonstop rollercoaster since, and I just don't know if it'll ever get better. 

I delivered her by C-section 3 weeks early due to gestational hypertension that showed up late in the third trimester. I struggled with elevated BP after her birth and was mortally afraid of developing preeclampsia postpartum, which led to multiple stressful office visits and even L&D triage early Christmas morning. I luckily never developed preeclampsia, but I spent anxious weeks on bp medication after it was finally prescribed at the end of December. 

Within a week of being discharged from the hospital after delivery, my husband got a bad cold. With baby being so young, we took aggressive steps to keep her healthy, which resulted in him staying largely separate from us for about 10 days and me taking care of her mostly on my own. At such an early stage, it was really hard, especially because I was still recovering from my C-section and super anxious about my bp and health and my daughter possibly getting sick. 

Every week after that brought other challenges--concerns about my daughter's weight, breathing, and hips (she was breech and may have hip dysplasia). We managed through all of that, one day at a time, though each thing was so stressful. 

I thought things were turning a corner last week, as my pressures had gotten consistently quite low and my OB gave me the OK to stop the bp meds on 1/20. But then I started feeling a bit under the weather last weekend, and developed very mild cold symptoms. Of course, I was again very scared of getting my daughter sick, so I started masking and moved to a different part of the house, though I continued nursing her while masked and after disinfecting. I tested negative for covid this past Monday, and my symptoms stayed mild, so I really believed I had a cold and just prayed it would pass soon. 

Wednesday and Thursday were a shitshow. Wednesday night, I woke up in a sweat and my heart felt like it was racing. The next morning I decided, randomly, to test again for covid, and it was a fast and very very strong positive. Though we've been very careful, covid is so transmissible, so my fears of getting my husband and daughter sick redoubled. 

I had been checking my pressures daily after stopping my meds, and I did the same Wednesday morning too. My pressures were sky high and my cuff was saying my heartbeat was irregular. I spoke to my PCP and we agreed I should go to the ER. I was there alone most of the day, and it was hard and scary. I was seeing bp numbers I've never seen before, and I was having heart palpitations. 

To make a long story short, the ER ruled out anything emergent, including very late onset preeclampsia. They blamed my high bp on covid and anxiety. The palpitations appeared benign on ekg but will require follow up with a cardiologist. They discharged me without bp medication, and that really scared me because my numbers were so high. I spent a long Thursday night quarantined--luckily my sister was able to come help my husband with our daughter. 

I was able to follow up with my PCP yesterday, who thinks I just came off bp meds too soon and I should restart them. She thinks the palpitations can be followed up on over the next weeks, not emergent, particularly as I do have a history of palpitations during times of extreme stress. That appointment comforted me, and my covid symptoms were so mild yesterday afternoon I basically didn't even feel sick. I thought I could see the light. 

But once night came, I woke up multiple times, feeling the palpitations (basically my pulse throughout my body), my mind going in all sorts of crazy directions. I toggled between worrying about something happening to me to my husband and daughter developing covid, and back again. 

I know there's not really a quick solution to any of this, I know I just have to keep walking through it. Weeks ago, I  recognized my anxiety needs management. I have therapy twice a week and my psychiatrist tweaked my meds (I have taken meds for decades for depression and anxiety). But things just keep happening, stacking up, it's just so hard. I'm really scared of having to deal with my husband and daughter being sick next. I just don't know how I'm going to get through this. 

I know this is really long and if you've read this far, thank you. Any words of support, hope, or comfort would be so appreciated.

He woke up super angry this morning. He woke up, started crying, and when I came in his room to check on him, he instantly got angry and started screaming and yelling ‚ÄúNO‚Äù and ‚ÄúMY MOMMY‚Äù (I‚Äôm his father). 

The anger continued as I changed his diaper and it didn‚Äôt subside until his mom came out of the bedroom to check on him and me. He‚Äôs having a lot of anger and general negativity lately, as in grumpiness, tantrums, or random anger fits. Energy levels are normal otherwise, he wants to play and ‚Äúread‚Äù books and all the things he usually wants to do, and he‚Äôs an otherwise healthy boy.

He. Just. Doesn‚Äôt. Want. To. Eat. 

It can be things he‚Äôs always loved, be it foods, fruits, or snacks, and now he only wants one bite, if that. Sometimes he‚Äôll get angry around dinner time because I‚Äôm interrupting his playtime to seat him at the table (because he no longer voluntarily goes on his own when he‚Äôs told that it‚Äôs dinner time). This ends in him absolutely refusing to eat anything we bring him, he angrily pushes his plate away (preferably all the way across the table, knocking things over if he can) and try as I might to be patient with him, it drives me up the fucking wall. 

He‚Äôs in daycare and he‚Äôs doing well there, usually eats a good bit of his lunch that we pack, the fruit they serve at 9, and whatever they serve in the afternoon. It‚Äôs dinner time and breakfast that is usually the issue, and while it may be that he‚Äôs just not hungry around those times (which I don‚Äôt think) he‚Äôs still losing weight and getting skinnier. It‚Äôs not to the point that he‚Äôs looking malnourished, but he‚Äôs definitely getting slimmer.

We try serving him all sorts of things; fruits, vegetables, breads (he‚Äôll usually eat white bread with butter lol) usual kiddie snacks, fruit smoothies, milk(which he happily drinks) and so on. 

The doctor says it‚Äôs probably due to him growing a lot verbally right now, which he very much is, but the lack of eating has come to a point where I‚Äôm getting really concerned and really frustrated.

Originally we had planned to put our kiddo in daycare at least part time, but my mother in law damn near insisted that she watch her for us. I appreciate it so much because it saves us thousands of dollars on day care and I know baby girl is with someone we can trust. Buuuuut ideally she would watch her more frequently. We both work demanding jobs and little one is super active, so when she‚Äôs home we basically don‚Äôt get any work done. When my mother in law first started watching the baby it was 5 days a week, but now I swear every other day she has an appointment or some errand she needs to run. And on the days that I ask her to watch her a little longer she jokes about how exhausted she is and how she needs the day off tomorrow. So I tell her we can keep her home the next day and we do this awkward, polite ‚Äúno, it‚Äôs fine, really‚Äù dance until I insist just to make it end, but then we don‚Äôt get any work done.

This sounds so horrible and inconsiderate‚Ä¶she‚Äôs literally watching my kid for me for free and here I am complaining!

beyondthebump,Diaper Recommendations? Need stretchy sides,"Hey all. I‚Äôve done so much research on different diapers and am finding it hard to narrow down which ones have stretchy side panels/stretchy straps/tabs etc. My baby is 90th percentile weighing 19 pounds and 27.5 inches long at 5 months. Pampers are a no because they gave him a rash when he was younger. 

We tried Huggies when he was 1 month old but EVERY SINGLE POOP blew out. And yes I put them on correctly, he was 50th percentile around that time so I‚Äôm not sure if they may work if I try again, but from the comparisons I‚Äôve done between other diapers we use, he does best with a diaper that has a bigger or longer ruffle past the leg seam, and Huggies seem to have a very short ruffle. 

We are currently using Millie Moon, just sized up to size 4 and even with putting the straps on his hips rather than meeting them in the middle (which is recommended for Millie‚Äôs from what I‚Äôve read) it just gets so tight on his hip and thigh area when he scrunches his legs, kicks, etc. 

We used honest for a while but switched because MM were cheaper and I‚Äôm thinking of going back to Honest since the side straps were stretchy and worked well on him. But I‚Äôd like to hear from other parents what diapers they like or know have nice stretchy sides. I LOVE MM but I‚Äôm worried with the no stretch side panels he will be resistant to learning to sit and crawl. I‚Äôm not sure if I should move up to size 5 even though we just sized up to 4, lmk your recommendations!! I‚Äôm interested in coterie, parasol, and other ECF or TCF for the most part. 


TLDR: looking for diaper reccs that have stretchy side panels/straps. Baby is in size 4 at 19 pounds, is 5 months old. Currently using MM which don‚Äôt have a lot of stretch, have tried Pampers, Huggies, and Honest. May revisit Huggies and honest. Baby has chonky legs and chonky belly. ",1738381074.0,1iexj7r

beyondthebump,She is getting worse,"We have a 4.5 month old, our first and hopefully only. 

She was jaundiced as a newborn and took 3-4 weeks to get out of her extremely sleepy state. It was fight to get her to eat - we had to basically torture her to stay awake long enough to eat. She slowly got more vocal and cry-y as the weeks went on. We kept being told that the worst cry-y weeks were from 6-10 weeks old, and then it would go down from there. 

Well. She is so fussy. I can't put her down for long before she cries. She can't sleep away from me. I have to hold her during her naps or she won't sleep longer than 30 minutes and then gets even fussier. We maybe have 1-2 hours a day where she's happy and we can all enjoy our time together. She loves being in the jolly jumper but she can't be in that for more than 45mins-1hr per day tops in 20 minute intervals. She is happiest when we hold her walking facing outward. Being in a carrier is no good. Going on walks with a stroller is only 30/70 chance of her not crying. We just got through the 4 month sleep regression but she hasn't gone back to 6 hour stretches for me to get some sleep, only about 2-4 hours at a time. She needs me to rock and bounce and often walk her to sleep. 

We keep thinking that not all babies are this way otherwise no one would be able to do anything with their babies. What are we doing wrong? Is there anything we can do? After a nap I get 30 mins of happy time with her then it's fussing for 1.5 hours before I get some respite with her being asleep, but not true respite cause I have to hold her and help keep her asleep. I can't do dishes or laundry or take my own nap or play a video game. My partner takes her when he gets home til 7:30 when I nurse her and put her to bed, and he spends 90% of that time trying to keep her from crying the entire time.

Our toddler is is sitting at about the 5%th percentile at 16 months for height.

I want to make sure when I talk about my toddler to others and to himself, I'm using positive/neutral language.

For those of you who are shorter, parciuarlily guys, and you had a positive/neutral experience growing up - how did your parents navigate your height in a positive or neutral way? Or how do you navigate this with your own kids?

For example, I'm realizing that when people ask about him and they comment that he's super advanced for his age. I say something along the lines of, ""Yea, he is actually 16 months, he is just small for his age."" Or, ""He's just a little guy.""

I have used Bonjela with my toddler (when he was a baby) and am using it again for my 8 month old. 

Toddler is fine and has no adverse effects (as far as I know) having used the gel. 

We give it to our daughter when she's particularly cranky at night from teething. 

It's come to my attention recently that there are some concerns with using the gel for babies. 

I feel quite guilty and stressed now having used it, however, the amount we use is probably half the size of a pea and we strictly have only given it once per night. I would say with our toddler, we probably used that dose about 25 times total (up to about a year old) and maybe 10 times so far with our daughter who is 8 months old. 

Some articles I've read seem to indicate that the concern is more around the volume being given to babies but I don't really know. 

Would love some insight from anyone who might know more and whether I should genuinely be concerned or maybe some alternative ""natural"" products.

beyondthebump,Changing nanny to family?,"Hi,

I wanted some advice, as hubby and I can't make up our minds. Last year, I gave birth and took 4 months maternity leave. When I returned to work, we hired a nanny as we didn't have any family help around and my hubby works from home, so we would be able to still be nearby and keep an eye.

Last month, an aunt from my husband's family moved to town, and is looking for a nanny job. We'd be paying the same as our nanny, but would give us the option of our LO being around family, and husband is RTO next month. She needs the job, so we would be helping family and also have a community nearby.

Pros on hiring aunt:
- she has extensive childcare experience and we trust her
- she has cared for our LO before and she is more active and engaged with LO than our nanny
- she lives nearby so there's less risk of being late (our nanny is constantly late by 15-20m)
- We'd be helping family
- she would be willing to stay late or overnight on special occasions (current nanny leaves at 5 or earlier on the dot)

Cons on hiring aunt:
- being able to set boundaries even though we are paying her. This is my main concern.
- hubby is worried We'd have a falling out and ruin the relationship (I've never had a falling out with the nanny, but I've had issues with my  MIL when she visits, she disrespects my boundaries)
- on occasions she might bring her son (8 year old) which I think is not a big deal

I personally like his aunt and I am open to changing nanny but I am so scared I let go of my nanny and things don't work out. My nanny is not perfect but I do trust her and she cares for my LO.

What would you guys do? The nanny market in my area is insane, so I doubt my nanny will wait around and would be hired quickly. That's the one thing that's holding me from just trying it out.

beyondthebump,For those who don‚Äôt feel ‚ÄúThe Bond‚Äù,"I felt like I had to type this out, perhaps it helps one other person out.

Almost a year ago I (32F) became a FTM. When I found out I was pregnant after TTC for close to 3 years, I was overjoyed. I read everything there was to find about pregnancy and childbirth to be (in my mind) completely prepared. I read ofcourse about mothers who experienced that they did not feel a bond with their baby, but since we tried so long for this baby I figured that it is something that could not happen to me (pure ignorance). So I dismissed that subject and ignored it further on.

Then the day finally came, my baby boy came in this world at 41w. They laid him on my chest and‚Ä¶ nothing. Ofcourse I was happy I finally had my baby boy that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm supposed to feel, I probably was just tired from being in labor for the whole day.

Morning comes we get the all clear to go home and meet up with the maternity help ( In my country you get up to a week of help to start you up, from babycare to momcare to housecare for a few hours a day) 
She kept telling me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be afraid to take the little one out of his bassinet to just cuddle if you want to‚Äù this stung every single time because I did not want to. 
In my mind I was in a state of turmoil ‚ÄúWhat was wrong with me?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy wouldn‚Äôt I want to hold that beautiful little baby boy?!‚Äù ‚ÄúI am the worst mother on the planet!‚Äù ‚ÄúThat little one doesn‚Äôt deserve such a loveless mother‚Äù etc etc. 
I just met her with a smile and said that I definitely would, but that I didn‚Äôt want to disturb him this very moment.

Time passed and so did my hope for feeling ‚Äúthe bond‚Äù. When people came to visit my partner holds the baby or I passed him eagerly to the visitors. 
I did however do everything I was expected to do and what I read about and cared for my baby as best as I could.
I EBF him till 10 months, I play hours with him everyday go on walks making sure his every need are met.

I do those things out of love for him, but it feels sort of empty. Maybe others know that feeling or know what I mean.
I know he likes me because he smiles the biggest smiles when he sees me.
The thoughts keep persisting that something must be wrong with me and I‚Äôm just the worst. 

Weeks and months go by and he starts growing so fast and becoming his own person. And I started getting little flutters of happiness and love when I‚Äôm with him. 

And tonight when he woke up for a bottle of milk I was going to put him back in his bed and something just told me to keep standing with him against my chest for a little longer. He cuddles sleepy against me and let me tell you it felt like my heart would explode. 
I did not want to put that wonderful baby boy back down and felt like I could stand there for ever holding him and loving him to the end of my days!

It took 11 months but I dare to say that empty feeling got filled up well over the rim and overflowing.

So I hope that if there are moms out there feeling the way I did for months and thinking those same thoughts, don‚Äôt give up hope just yet because it could just take a little bit longer for you to feel ‚Äúthe bond‚Äù ",1738369650.0,1ietvay

He was coughing so hard it was to the point that if I didn‚Äôt intervene, he probably would have died from how bad he was choking. The whole ordeal lasted about two minutes. It was the most terrifying two minutes of my entire life. Once it was over. He was fine and crying and alert and what not I got nervous so I brought him to the ER just to get checked out. He was perfect in the ER. His lungs were clear. The doctor was impressed with how alert he was that was probably about 3 o‚Äôclock in the afternoon Since I got him home at 5:30 and mind you he was in the car seat for about two hours, he‚Äôs been sleepy. As soon as we got home, I broke down in tears, took him out of his car seat and snuggled him tight. I propped him up on a pillow and just sat there watching him suck on his pacifier and he looks so cute and so innocent, and I‚Äôm just a wreck. I think the whole ordeal stressed his little body out since being home we have had about 3, 15 minute nursing sessions. He‚Äôs eating perfect and latching perfect.

beyondthebump,Baby who can't be calmed at bedtime?,"I'm wondering if anyone else has had a baby like this and has any tips. 

My 5mo used to sleep really well at night. He's been in his own room since 2 months old and he was falling asleep independently before that. 

We were not in the habit of rocking him in our arms or nursing him to sleep. 

Since getting home from our holiday travels in mid-January, he has had a dramatic shift. He had already been waking up more at night (4month regression) but after coming home, it's like a different baby at night time. 

Nothing soothes him. Nothing. 

I have tried everything that's supposed to be soothing to babies. Pitch black rooms seem to energize him. He has a light projector/white noise machine that seems to soothe him for a while but once he realizes he is drowsy he starts to get mad. He no longer will take a paci. If I try to rock him he fights it. If I try to walk around the room with him he tries to smile and play with me. If I sing or hush or pat him, he won't soothe. I've tried books but on the third night he realized books meant bedtime and now won't let me read to him. I've tried a special bedtime music box but he couldn't care less. I've tried comforting him crib side while he fussed, leaving the room while he fussed. I've tried pick up put down but in the second night he refused to be calmed when picked up. 

Sometimes, nursing will calm him down. I can then put him in bed and he will roll over and sleep. Other times, nursing just makes him angry.

On really bad nights, we end up giving up and putting him in his stroller. He will fall asleep almost instantly in his carry cot but this obviously isn't sustainable. 

I know he needs to learn to go to sleep in his bed but I don't know what to do at this point. 

Has anyone had a baby like this? It's like overnight he decided he hates night time. And he seems to learn what methods make him fall asleep and fight them on subsequent nights. I don't know how to help him. What ended up working for you? ",1738350817.0,1iemob7

Because of that he's usually exhausted by one hour in to being awake. We have tried to encourage him to stay awake longer but there's only so much we can keep him awake. If he's fussing then we can distract him but if he's crying then he obviously needs sleep. 

We managed to get one 2 hour wake window today which is something. He has done 1.5/1.5/2/1.5. Did anyone else's baby just take a little longer to be awake more? Does anyone else's baby also get very fussy after only 45 minutes - 1 hour being awake?

EDIT: Thank you so much for all the replies everyone! I'm compiling a list and we'll be ordering a bunch of different brands to test absorbency (maybe I'll even post the results here)!

I got a lot of comments from people recommending we put cotton in the diaper, and this is actually what we do! We put a small strip of cotton between the baby and the diaper and then (try to) squeeze out the urine with a syringe. We have not had a high degree of success with this because the diaper wicks the urine away from the cotton if we don't change the diaper quickly enough. If anyone who uses this technique has any advice on how to improve success, I'm definitely open to hearing it!",1738348381.0,1ielp77

beyondthebump,Solidarity for the parents of non-unicorn babies... aka dragon babies.,"I don't like the term ""hard baby"" so I've decided to say I have a dragon baby, in comparison to the unicorn babies.

My dragon baby is almost 4 weeks old. He cries for the boob once an hour (2-3 hours my ass). Won't sleep for more than 2 hours, even at night. Only sleeps if latched or held. Likes to scratch and punch if not swaddled, but also hates being swaddled. Has witching hours every evening, gas pains hours every morning. Cries immediately after peeing diaper. Cries during baths. Cries when getting dressed. Cries during fast letdown and cries during slow letdown. Cries if dad holds him. Cries if TV is on. And probably cries for other reasons that I haven't picked up on. 

But while my newborn game might be stuck on expert difficulty level, I guess I'm happy to get the full experience so that everything else will seem easier in comparison lol. ",1738346613.0,1iekzhu

beyondthebump,Bottle Transition to Cup Please Help! Anybody on straws gone back to a sippy?,"LO is 13mos, and still gets one 8oz cows milk bottle before bed I‚Äôm looking to wean. She likes the cows milk taste just fine, but is SO picky about any cup other than her bottle she will only reliably drink like at most 5oz spread out throughout the day and that‚Äôs me putting in WORK, offering it constantly.

She LOVES yogurt and cheese and ultimately the ped said it‚Äôs fine if she doesn‚Äôt want to drink milk but the problem is she DOES. She gets upset throughout the day wanting milk. I offer plenty of snacks and dairy and it subsides her but sometimes I swear she just wants her bottles. Esp rn because she‚Äôs got two molars coming in. When it‚Äôs time for the bedtime bottle she is PISSED, until she gets it.

She has known how to use straws for months and only used a sippy cup for about a month or two before she figured out straws and I got rid of the sippy.

She uses a Dr Browns weighted straw cup for water that works fine for her. She hates milk in it, though.
She has a Moonkie Baby straw cup (not weighted) that she gets like 3oz out of at most, but when the milk gets low enough she tilts the cup and then the milk is too far below the straw and she gives up. She also sucks the straw way too hard and tuckers herself out lol.

(I might add, she had a terrible latch when we BF and she pretty much only drank the letdown because it was easy. When we switched to EFF she liked a FAST nipple flow because of the same reasons. If it‚Äôs too much work, she tires and gives up). 

So we thought open cup, we‚Äôve practiced a ton. She had a Dr Browns 360 open cup and I hate it. The valve in it was WAY too slow and without the valve, it‚Äôs like milk can come any angle and it spills out the middle. She‚Äôs also a (said with love) weenie when milk spills on her so that doesn‚Äôt help lol. 

I‚Äôve tried a small yeti with a lid for a small area of milk to come out. I even put a travel coffee mug lid on her cup (oddly fit lol) this morning and she drank a couple oz. Everything flows too fast. But the travel mug lid seemed like she liked it the best, which makes me feel like she may just ultimately like a sippy cup best for now. 

Anybody have any cups, products or advice on this? Has anybody gone back to a sippy specifically for milk?",1738341229.0,1ieit94
beyondthebump,Child delayed due to pain??,"Looking for some reassurance here.

Baby is 19 weeks old and hardly interacts. Hasn't smiled yet.

She is crying(screaming in pain)non stop from about 3 weeks old. Doctors said reflux, colic, cmpa, etc. she has never fed well. Used to drink 30ml in one go and we were feeding her round the clock. At 16 weeks old, she dropped some weight and doctors finally took her seriously. We were in hospital for a few weeks and after lots of specialists examining her, we have been told she has some kind of hypersensitivity to stomach acid. She is on hypoallergenic formula now and we are seeing some symptoms changing (not completely solved yet). She is still constantly in pain. And I am not exaggerating. Every minute awake is crying, arching back, straining, gulping down reflux. She is now partly Ng tube fed and weight gain is better. We have an EEG and an MRI scheduled for the next month.

Occupational therapist says it's possible pain is delaying her as she can't focus on anything. Because she is crying all the the time, she doesn't get the same exposure other kids her age do. SALT also said feeding issues should be solved if pain is resolved. She doesn't have a problem with her swallow. I'm hoping that is the case and she will catch up when the pain resolves. Hopefully the brain scans will not show anything problematic.

Before having a baby we had a great relationship and we were both really happy. Things have been really hard on me since with having PPD/PPA. I‚Äôve been doing much better recently (9 months pp). But I still get overwhelmed a lot. The mental load is heavy and I feel like I‚Äôm constantly the one doing/thinking of everything. I think I‚Äôm just burnt out and I need help. We have no other support besides each other. 

I try to communicate that I  am overwhelmed mentally and I need him to take things off my plate. He just doesn‚Äôt get it. My therapist suggested I make him a list. So I did, I put down for him to plan meals and grocery shop this week, secure furniture for baby proofing, and to lower the crib because our baby is pulling to stand on everything. 

Well he did grocery shop, but only got the main part of a meal and nothing else (so the meat for a pot roast but none of the veggies/other ingredients). He never secured any of the furniture after weeks and weeks. But he has time to organize the basement/garage, go out with friends, take naps 2x a day ect. I finally snapped and just started balling because my baby almost pulled our mirror onto himself. He secured that but hasn‚Äôt done any of the other furniture, and I just ended up lowering the crib myself. This goes on, and he‚Äôs very helpful with caring for the baby so he thinks that‚Äôs enough. But nothing is ever completed for me, I still had to tell him we need all these other ingredients. I still had to get to a breaking point for him to finally do one thing. I still had to do the crib. And it makes me so upset because it‚Äôs stuff to do with our babies safety! And I just can‚Äôt be the one doing everything and thinking of everything ALL the time. 

On top of this we have 0 emotional connection right now. I don‚Äôt feel heard, I feel alone, and I feel neglected. He doesn‚Äôt seem to notice or care that we barley have a relationship. I don‚Äôt even care about gifts, but for Christmas he got me stuff that he‚Äôs more into, and it just feels like he doesn‚Äôt even know me at all. I just want to give up communicating completely because he doesn‚Äôt hear what I‚Äôm saying at all. It‚Äôs in one ear out the other. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to do at this point. We can‚Äôt afford couples therapy too, and at this point I think it would be the same thing of him agreeing to try things and not actually following through. I just want to check out.

beyondthebump,I found my husband's porn folder on his laptop; at 9 weeks pregnant and feel like I'm spiraling?,"So - a few weeks ago, I'd notice that anytime I walked past the den in our apartment my husband would exit out of the folder he had opened immediately which I thought was really bizarre. It wasn't a one time occurence - it happened a couple times (enough for me to notice and start questioning what he was so keen on hiding).

One day when my husband was in the shower, I went on his laptop to check and found a folder with tons of porn downloaded on it - all from maybe the last 6 months or so but most recently from a few weeks ago. And I went on his internet browser history where there a few more videos actively in the process of being downloaded. I completely freaked out (internally) because it was so far from what I expected him to be hiding.

We've been together for 5 years and just got married in September. Post wedding life HAS been a little hectic as we've had tons of plans and travel that came up and I'll admit that our sex life has taken the back burner a bit. I felt bad because it made me think that the reason he was downloading so much porn was lack of satisfaction in the bedroom.

He's otherwise the most attentive partner - loving, cooks amazing meals, very organized, honestly cleaner than me, and a medical professional; all and all an amazing person. We don't really have issues in the bedroom though it DOES take him a very long time to finish but there hasn't really been an instance where he HASNT finished during sex; just takes longer than the average guy.

After I found what I did, I was reeling with myself about whether I should confront about him about it but was at a crossroads because I KNOW people watch porn - I know i've used it before (even while we were dating) when we weren't around each other. But post wedding, I haven't had the need to use porn because I'm happy with having sex with him.

That being said, I realized I should likely put in more of an effort in our sex life and since then we've actively been having much more sex (maybe 4-5 times a week) - I'm happy with it and so is he (I think).

I recognize porn usage is normal - but a couple days ago, I made it very apparent that I was in the mood and I was waiting for him to come to bed. He said he would come later because he had to finish up some work and also book some flight tickets for a friend's bachelor trip. At this point, I feel like can't even really trust that because I just think he's using it as an excuse to watch porn in the den.

I left the door to our room open and he specifically came by to shut the door and go b ack to the den.

When he finally came to the room, we eventually started having sex but had to stop because he couldn't finish (he said he was too sensitive). This hasn't happened to us before and felt more indicative of the fact that he had just watched porn. He did get me off but in hindsight I still feel sad about it; he chose to prioritize watching porn over intimacy with his wife in the room next door. ***It's one thing if this was at times when I'm gone but I can't wrap my head around the fact that I was just in the other room***

Yesterday out of fear, I checked his laptop folder again and he had downloaded porn the SAME day. My heart sank and I can't stop thinking about it; though I didn't watch it, the videos from their title don't scream anything beyond your average porn video.

That being said, I just can't help but feel really sad that the shift in our sex life hasn't been a deterrent to him watching porn and at the same I feel even guilty about reacting this way because I know so many men watch porn.

Our relationship REALLY has been perfect with very few fights but I feel like I'm rehashing PTSD now from a previous relationship where a partner cheated on me. I feel the need to check his phone, laptop, and I'm now panicking that he's using apps like Only Fans or Tinder.

I know this is spiraling but I cannot help myself and think this way; it's especially harder because I'm at 9 weeks and I worry about what will happen when I'm closer to the end of my trimester (and it's more uncomfortable to have sex), how he'll deal.

Also side note - I'm getting the ick about the fact that he's DOWNLOADING porn??? Something that is so accessible online through sites. Like is viewing it not enough; is there a reason you need an archive? I think half the reason I'm so bothered is because he has an entire folder of it. I have no clue WHERE he's downloading it from but I can tell when it's from one person or porn star because it'll be a few videos with the same porn star's name in the title because it moves on to the next video.

I don't even know how to bring it up to him because I literally went on his computer and found a folder where he kept it.

I'm at a loss for what to do and would love any advice or words of reassurance (or alternatively note if I am just being crazy).",1738330416.0,1ieev73

Now for the scary part, after being here for a few hours she mentioned she saw flashing lights (7pm ish). 6cm dilated at 6 pm immediately before epidural and by the time she saw the flashing lights they assumed she would be about 7cm. They flipped her over to try to help the flashing when she very suddenly had an eclamptic seizure. Never seized in her life and this was a huge shock for me. She was dilated 9cm by this point and while her BP skyrocketed the baby‚Äôs heart rate plummeted. Went from 135 to 50 in seconds. She was immediately rushed to an OR for an emergency c section. 

They allowed me in and thankfully by then she was stable and responsive and baby was stable again (after 8 minutes down). I did everything from helping hold her on her side while she tried to roll back before the OR (despite there being 20ish nurses in the room), rubbing her back and giving kisses and comforting her the best I could. She was not coherent and doesn‚Äôt remember of course but I was never not going to do something. In the OR they let me hold her hand and be there too where I continued the same comforting and by this time she was awake and acknowledging and responsive to me however she doesn‚Äôt remember this either thankfully.

I received many compliments and good words from nurses and the parents about it and she heard them as well and was very thankful. Honestly though I felt so incredibly sick and panicked and have never been more scared in my entire life. Now she is okay and so is baby.

beyondthebump,Worst labor experience. Epidural didn‚Äôt work???,"Hi everyone. II gave birth to my first child 12 hours ago and the experience almost killed me.

The doctor said my child was big for a natural delivery, so we induced my labor 10 days before my due date.

I came to the hospital al 7 am and they induced me. At around 11 I started getting some mild contractions, then they stopped. At around 3 pm the nurse broke my water with her hand and that‚Äôs when contractions got stronger. I asked for an epidural at around 4. Soon enougu I couldn‚Äôt feel the contractions, but at around 5 they were back! And my baby wasn‚Äôt descending. I asked for more epidural which helped for like 30 minutes and then I WAS IN THE MOST EXCRUTIATING PAIN OF MY LIFE!

I wasn‚Äôt fully dilated, but they asked me to push to bring her down, and then I felt the pain in my bones‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs when contractions got so painful that I started screaming, and screaming to the top of my lungs, and they came and they started tell me to push. I was barely push but I pushed and the baby wasn‚Äôt coming out. My lungs were about to explode from my screams. I started screaming for help to take the baby out and the doctor promised he would help. 3 nurses held me down while I pushed and then one squeezed my belly down and I screemed as someone whi is being tortured. I couldn‚Äôt breath and thought I was gonna die. 

My baby got out after that and some pushes from mommy. I couldn‚Äôt even hold her or cry or be happy, I was laying in bed half dead with my baby on my chest. They had to put my hands around her to feel her! I gave birth at 7:25 pm so about 12 hours after I was induced.

Now, WHAT HAPPENED THERE? The only reason why I chose a natural birth was because I thought the epidural was gonna make it nice and smooth. Instead, I had a middle-ages experience that almost killed me. I was wondering if I got rushed and maybe wasn‚Äôt provided with enough epidural injection on purpose to make it quicker, of course without them foreseeing it was going to be like a horror movie scene.

beyondthebump,My baby is dropping in weight percentile consistently,"Birth weight: 6 lb 8 oz

1 month: 8 lb

2 months: 9 lb 11 oz

2 months 2 weeks: 10 lb 2 oz

I‚Äôm primarily breastfeeding, with 2-3 bottle feeds of pumped milk per day. We‚Äôve done weighted feeds, and she typically takes around 2 oz per session. She feeds frequently‚Äîat least 12-13 times a day, with each session lasting 6-15 minutes.

Our pediatrician recommended adding ¬Ω tsp of high-calorie formula to 2 oz of milk when bottle-feeding. Based on our rough estimates, she‚Äôs consuming around 20 oz per day, though getting her to take that much is a challenge. She often isn‚Äôt interested, and finishing a bottle can take a long time.

She‚Äôs a generally content baby and doesn‚Äôt fuss much, even when going long stretches without eating. If we don‚Äôt wake her, she often sleeps through the night. Recently, we started sneaking in 1-2 dream feeds, and she surprisingly takes 2-3 oz in her sleep. Oddly, after 7-8 hours without a feed, I‚Äôd expect her to wake up fussy and hungry‚Äîbut she often isn‚Äôt. She roughly has 4-5 wet and 1-2 poopy diapers everyday.

I have an overactive letdown, so I‚Äôve been trying to pump before feeds, especially after longer gaps. It feels like we‚Äôre doing everything we can, yet she‚Äôs still not gaining as expected.

beyondthebump,"Need to hear from those on ""the other side"" of sleep struggles","I apologize this is so long, but I feel the need to write this all out. I'm a first time mom to a 20 week old. I have PPA that I am starting CBT for. My main source of anxiety comes from feeling like I'm doing everything wrong when it comes to my baby's sleep. My husband is very rational and is always saying we aren't doing anything wrong, we are doing what works for us. 

Little dude's been pretty great at night. We usually get one wake up, and if we feed him he goes right back to sleep. We have found that for now he needs to go to bed no earlier than 9pm otherwise his sleep patterns get all messed up. That's fine with us. We always put him in his bassinet asleep after a bottle and sometimes bouncing him and he's good at staying asleep or self soothing if he wakes up and isn't hungry yet. 

Naps are a whole thing. I take my dog and baby for a walk in the morning around his first nap time. Generally he falls asleep and does about 1.5 hours. Second nap is hit and miss. Sometimes he does great, other times it's 30 minutes and I can't get him back down without doing a contact nap. When doing said contact nap, I nurse him to sleep then pop him off the boob to continue sleeping in my arms. I feel this is comforting, but taking away from him learning independent sleep. I know at this age they struggle to connect sleep cycles, so I just keep trying and waiting for him to develop that skill in the next month or two. Last nap of the day is much the same, or like last night it just didn't happen. He made it to 9pm ok somehow without getting  too overtired or cranky.

As I mentioned, I'm nursing or bottle feeding to sleep and contact napping and using the stroller to get these naps for him. I care more about him getting the sleep than how it happens, because I know naps and nighttime sleep are closely connected and I need him to keep being a good sleeper at night (my mental health takes a huge hit if I don't sleep). What I need to hear is that I'm not screwing this all up. I need people who did similar ""wrong"" things to tell me that their babies eventually figured sleep out and that what I'm doing isn't creating bad habits. I need to hear that feeding to sleep is just how some babies need to fall asleep. I want to know that I don't HAVE to get him to do ""drowsy but awake"" or sleep train to get him to sleep in the future.

So during pregnancy, my heart was set on EBF. My baby latched beautifully in the hospital but as soon as I was home without the help of LCs, I had a much harder time getting baby to latch, especially because my milk wasn‚Äôt in. I also was anxious not seeing how much milk he was getting each feed. I was anxious about everything the first two weeks (FTM things ü§™) and this anxiety led me to make the choice to exclusively pump. I have been exclusively pumping for this whole month and it‚Äôs honestly going great. I‚Äôm blessed to have an oversupply and I have a freezer stash built. With that being said, my anxiety has severely lessened now that baby is gaining weight and we have a routine. Exclusively pumping has made me a little sad knowing I‚Äôm missing out on the bond breastfeeding provides, and also, f*ck washing pump parts and bottles. 

So this morning, I decided to see if baby still remembered how to latch and HE DID without any trouble at all!!! He nursed on both sides for about 15 minutes and fell asleep immediately after. I don‚Äôt want to give up pumping entirely because again I like the reassurance of knowing how much he‚Äôs getting and sometimes a bottle is the move since it‚Äôs quicker than nursing.
