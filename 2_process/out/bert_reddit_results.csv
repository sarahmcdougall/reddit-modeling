affordable way feed people well costing 200 throw party 30 guest getting 200 worth gift personally wait anyone offer host baby shower know none friendscousins would expect luckily parent restaurant party would basically free including food lucky regard option would pay money rent place catering would still host something house limited amount guest pizzasnacks even though option co ed want 40 people show thought would feel overwhelming almost like small wedding decided girl exception husband dad one uncle cut guest list 20 still pay cake party favor decoration got lot amazon 100 total went trader joes get flower 20 made small bouquet centerpiece etc definitely send gift registry anything far showercelebration come tacky would worry inviting male guest stick closest female relative

worth also place 100 ok could afford buying everything wanted needed without anyones help feel like shower mattered park public library fairly inexpensive either option appeal otherwise end world end party never wanted one never one far know nobody offended think would rude create registry anyway way people ask wantneed direct think thing would come across rude party still sent registry people without asking similar boat opted luncheon favourite restaurant guest pay lunch minimum spend venue hire meal end covering cost rather pocket except gift wishing well anyone want leave card end day id rather spend money would spend hosting baby shower thing well actually need really wanted favourite people room celebrate particularly throe postpartum id like able remember village sussed idea friend understanding supportive think weird shower post registry exactly live 3000 mile away home family nearby husband military lot people express interest supporting u obviously could shower feasible fly across country somehow bring thing home send registry people unless asked posted link fb page noted would appreciate prayer healthy safe pregnancy true pressure option many friend done one saw weird post link every day start begging yes weird posting registry link social medium sending family ask without shower weird opinion seems like minority id make registry live different province family friend asked registry several time people would crossing 3 province attend shower need send everyone want think posting group close family friend sharing nothing expected case anyone want help make registry think anyone baby baby shower gifted thing baby shower also community aspect sometimes possible know personally still try support friend family huge life change like sorry anyone throw shower

particular area work well super large longer group attended charge extra charge mandatory tip fee large group fee something usually pretty minimal require everybody order food drink course many place even keep cake back bring candle blow cake eating time fair live canada imagine similar everywhere especially picking place time patronage place question busy owner want accommodate going much profit 30 people ordering food drink maybe even apps dessert another idea use something like zoom clubhouse host registry gift opening party online sister covid actually worked pretty well even play shower game pretty well online course free last thought maybe close womens never know many folk paternal side might die chance throw shower never say anything cuz kind earmarked maternal side thing even able help like plan game help decor etc might want put feeler see maybe eager beaver dying take part party planning believed ill throw venue suggestion bridal shower hotel conference room 200 4 hour included table chair basic linen fee set uptake decor brought baby shower well worked perfectly friend found restaurant party room charge u use space would call different restaurant see anyone area could use without actually rent space also helpful people order food drink worry providing provided cupcake cooky candy dessert take home goody id reccomend public park completely free plenty space
